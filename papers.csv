syed_cnn-lstm_2023,misc,"Syed, Md Asif Bin and Ahmed, Imtiaz",A CNN-LSTM Architecture for Marine Vessel Track Association Using Automatic Identification System (AIS) Data,"In marine surveillance, distinguishing between normal and anomalous vessel movement patterns is critical for identifying potential threats in a timely manner. Once detected, it is important to monitor and track these vessels until a necessary intervention occurs. To achieve this, track association algorithms are used, which take sequential observations comprising geological and motion parameters of the vessels and associate them with respective vessels. The spatial and temporal variations inherent in these sequential observations make the association task challenging for traditional multi-object tracking algorithms. Additionally, the presence of overlapping tracks and missing data can further complicate the trajectory tracking process. To address these challenges, in this study, we approach this tracking task as a multivariate time series problem and introduce a 1D CNNLSTM architecture-based framework for track association. This special neural network architecture can capture the spatial patterns as well as the long-term temporal relations that exist among the sequential observations. During the training process, it learns and builds the trajectory for each of these underlying vessels. Once trained, the proposed framework takes the marine vessel’s location and motion data collected through the Automatic Identification System (AIS) as input and returns the most likely vessel track as output in real-time. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we utilize an AIS dataset containing observations from 327 vessels traveling in a specific geographic region. We measure the performance of our proposed framework using standard performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. When compared with other competitive neural network architectures our approach demonstrates a superior tracking performance.",,"Comment: No results has been changed, Changed Figures, increased the resolution of the figures, changed slightly in the description in section 3.3.3",,,,2303.14068.pdf:/media/aweissen/ef6d006c-11d1-45ba-ad13-50a91575ccd91/projects/papers/anita/literatur_axel/2303.14068.pdf:application/pdf,,,,,Computer Science - Machine Learning,en,jun,arXiv:2303.14068 [cs],,,arXiv,,,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14068,2023-06-18,,2023.0,Trajectory prediction/imputation,CNN-LSTM,article,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the existing approaches for short-term trafﬁc ﬂow prediction are unable to efﬁciently capture the complex nonlinearity of trafﬁc ﬂow, which provide unsatisfactory prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based model which uses hybrid and multiple-layer architectures to automatically extract inherent features of trafﬁc ﬂow data. Firstly, built on the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the long short-term memory (LSTM) network, we develop an attention-based Conv-LSTM module to extract the spatial and short-term temporal features. The attention mechanism is properly designed to distinguish the importance of ﬂow sequences at different times by automatically assigning different weights. Secondly, to further explore long-term temporal features, we propose a bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) module to extract daily and weekly periodic features so as to capture variance tendency of the trafﬁc ﬂow from both previous and posterior directions. Finally, extensive experimental results are presented to show that the proposed model combining the attention Conv-LSTM and Bi-LSTM achieves better prediction performance compared with other existing approaches.",,,,10.1109/TITS.2020.2997352,,A_Hybrid_Deep_Learning_Model_With_Attention-Based_Conv-LSTM_Networks_for_Short-Term_Traffic_Flow_Prediction.pdf:/media/aweissen/ef6d006c-11d1-45ba-ad13-50a91575ccd91/projects/papers/anita/2022/data/A_Hybrid_Deep_Learning_Model_With_Attention-Based_Conv-LSTM_Networks_for_Short-Term_Traffic_Flow_Prediction.pdf:application/pdf,,,"1524-9050, 1558-0016",IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,,en,nov,,11.0,6910--6920,,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9112272/,2023-06-25,22.0,2021.0,Traffic volume prediction,Attention-based LSTM,journal,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Trafﬁc ﬂow prediction is a thorny task using this kind of data. A smart trafﬁc congestion prediction system is a need of sustainable and economical smart cities. An intelligent trafﬁc congestion prediction model using Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) is presented in this study. The novelty of this model is that the proposed model is hybridized using a Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN). Instead of traditionally presuming the relationship of forecasted results of the SARIMA and Bi-LSTM model as a linear relationship, this model uses BPNN to discover the unknown function to establish a relation between the forecasted values. This model uses SARIMA to handle linear components and Bi-LSTM to handle non-linear components of the Big IoT time-series dataset. The “CityPulse EU FP7 project” is a freely available dataset used in this study. This hybrid univariate model is compared with the single ARIMA, single LSTM, and existing trafﬁc prediction models using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE as evaluation indicators. This model provides the lowest values of MAE, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE as 0.499, 0.337, 0.58, and 0.03, respectively.

In fact, coarse-grained signals (i.e., region- and global-level check-ins) in such sparse check-ins would also benefit to augment user preference learning. Specifically, our data analysis unveils that user movement exhibits noticeable patterns w.r.t. the regions of visited POIs. Meanwhile, the global all-user check-ins can help reflect sequential regularities shared by the crowd. We are, therefore, inspired to propose the MCMG: a Multi-Channel next POI recommendation framework with Multi-Granularity signals categorized from two orthogonal perspectives, i.e., fine-coarse grained check-ins at either POI/region level or local/global level. Being equipped with three modules (i.e., global user behavior encoder, local multi-channel encoder, and region-aware weighting strategy), MCMG is capable of capturing both fine- and coarse-grained sequential regularities as well as exploring the dynamic impact of multi-channel by differentiating the region check-in patterns.

However, how to use massive trajectory data and spatial-temporal context information effectively to mine the user’s mobility pattern and predict the users’ next location is still unresolved. In this paper, we propose a novel network named STSAN (spatial-temporal self-attention network), which can integrate spatial-temporal information with the self-attention for location prediction. In STSAN, we design a trajectory attention module to learn users’ dynamic trajectory representation, which includes three modules: location attention, which captures the location sequential transitions with self-attention; spatial attention, which captures user’s preference for geographic location; and temporal attention, which captures the user temporal activity preference. Finally, extensive experiments on four real-world check-ins datasets are designed to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.

zhang_spatiotemporal_2023,article,"Zhang, Linjie and Ma, Jianfeng",A Spatiotemporal Graph Wavelet Neural Network for Traffic Flow Prediction,"The traffic flow prediction is fast becoming a key instrument in the transportation system, which has achieved impressive performance for the traffic management. The graph neural network plays a critical role in the maintenance of development of the traffic network management. However, it is worthwhile mentioning that the complexity of road network and traffic conditions makes it unable to obtain sufficient spatiotemporal information. In view of capturing precise environment characteristics, the context could have a precise effect on the prediction results while previous methods rarely took this into account. Besides, the nonlinear characteristics of the graph neural network are hard to quantify with fine granularity and to eliminate overfitting. To stack these challenges, in this paper, we present spatiotemporal graph wavelet neural network, a novel hierarchical graph architecture to improve the ability of representations. Specifically, we introduce the wavelet transforms into the deep learning according to the strong nonlinear optimization ability. Furthermore, we dig the location and time patterns to evaluate the temporal dependence and the spatial proximity correlation.

Considering the complex and variable trafﬁc environment, so that the trafﬁc ﬂow contains a large number of non-linear characteristics, which makes it difﬁcult to improve the prediction accuracy, a combined prediction model that reduces the unsteadiness of trafﬁc ﬂow and fully extracts the trafﬁc ﬂow features is proposed. Firstly, decompose the trafﬁc ﬂow data into multiple components by the seasonal and trend decomposition using loess (STL); these components contain different features, and the optimized variational modal decomposition (VMD) is used for the second decomposition of the component with large ﬂuctuation frequencies, and then the components are reconstructed according to the fuzzy entropy and LempelZiv complexity index and the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient is used to ﬁlter the trafﬁc ﬂow features. Then light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), long short-term memory with attention mechanism (LA), and kernel extreme learning machine with genetic algorithm optimization (GA-KELM) are built for prediction. Finally, we use reinforcement learning to integrate the advantages of each model, and the weights of each model are determined to obtain the best prediction results. The case study shows that the model established in this paper is better than other models in predicting urban road trafﬁc ﬂow, with an average absolute error of 2.622 and a root mean square error of 3.479, both of which are lower than the prediction errors of other models, indicating that the model can fully extract the features in complex trafﬁc ﬂow.",,,,10.3390/app12167978,,applsci-12-07978.pdf:/media/aweissen/ef6d006c-11d1-45ba-ad13-50a91575ccd91/projects/papers/anita/2022/data/applsci-12-07978.pdf:application/pdf,,,2076-3417,Applied Sciences,,en,aug,,16.0,7978,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/16/7978,2023-06-25,12.0,2022.0,Traffic volume prediction,"Attention-based LSTM, reinforcement learning",article,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a comparison, we focus on the evaluation of the anomalies of driving habits for different drivers based on their trajectory data. This is particularly important for the application of adjusting the amount of in­ surance in accordance with the driving behaviors. Instead of customizing rules for modeling various driving behaviors, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework for driving trajectory anomaly detection, called STDTB-AD. Specifically, taking into account the fact that movement is spatial–temporal dependent, the study first partitions the whole road network into a series of spatial–temporal units, which have homogeneous prop­ erties of traffic flows. Then, the motion parameters (i.e., acceleration, speed, and direction) of driving trajectories falling within each spatio-temporal unit are calculated for representing context-aware features of drivers. This method is able to detect the deviation of movement from the normal traffic state on the spatial–temporal units. Finally, a variational autoencoder is utilized to quantify the abnormity degree of each driver according to the reconstruction probability of driving feature vector. Evaluations based on taxi trajectory data show that our model can consider both the spatial and temporal contexts for detecting driving behavior anomalies and achieve higher detection accuracy than traditional models based on either spatial or temporal context.",,,,10.1016/j.jag.2022.103115,,1-s2.0-S156984322200303X-main.pdf:/media/aweissen/ef6d006c-11d1-45ba-ad13-50a91575ccd91/projects/papers/anita/literatur_axel/1-s2.0-S156984322200303X-main.pdf:application/pdf,,,15698432,International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation,,en,dec,,,103115,,,,https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S156984322200303X,2023-06-18,115.0,2022.0,Anomaly detection,variational autoencoder,journal,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to the mooring line tension usually has the typical lowfrequency and wave-frequency characteristics, this paper proposes a method of Low-frequency adds wavefrequency responses (LAWR) to predict the mooring line tension. Firstly, the optimal Long-short term memory (LSTM) neural network structure is determined through conducting the parameter sensitivity analysis on the performance of the LSTM model. Secondly, the low-frequency and wave-frequency tension are predicted using the corresponding low-frequency and wave-frequency responses as the input data, respectively.

The model extracts patterns from the trajectories with an encoder network and reconstructs the trajectories using these patterns with a decoder network. We use attention mechanisms to highlight certain extracted patterns as well for the decoder. We also feed these patterns into a second decoder for prediction and imputation.

duan_semi-supervised_2022,article,"Duan, Hongda and Ma, Fei and Miao, Lixin and Zhang, Canrong",A semi-supervised deep learning approach for vessel trajectory classification based on AIS data,"Automatic identification system (AIS) refers to a new type of navigation aid system equipped in maritime vehicles to monitor ship performance. It provides trajectory information of vessels which can be used for the classification task. The classification results facilitate ocean surveillance and conservation, vessel management enhancement, fishery regulation, marine ecological sustainability, and nautical safety protection. Some progresses have been made based on machine learning or deep learning strategies to perform supervised learning by assuming that during the training process, the category labels of historical trajectory data are available. However, in reality, the label information may be difficult or expensive to obtain, resulting in that only a small part of the training data is labeled, and most of the training data is unlabeled. To address this issue, this paper proposes a semi-supervised deep learning approach to integrate the knowledge of unlabeled data for vessel trajectory classification. Here, we call our approach SSL-VTC. Specifically, we first extract vessel trajectories by integrating the kinematic and static information from historical AIS messages. Then, we design convolutional neural networks to extract feature representations from the vessel trajectories. Finally, we develop a semi-supervised learning algorithm based on the variational autoencoder to perform discriminative learning and generative learning simultaneously. In this way, our SSL-VTC framework can fully leverage the labeled data and unlabeled data during the training process. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to utilize semi-supervised learning for vessel trajectory classification. Experimental results on the public AIS dataset show that our SSL-VTC can effectively extract feature representations from the AIS messages and its performance is significantly better than the traditional supervised learning methods.

Currently, most of collision accidents at sea are caused by the misjudgement of the ship’s operators. The deployment of maritime autonomous surface ships (MASS) can greatly reduce ships’ reliance on human operators by using an automated intelligent collision avoidance system to replace human decision-making. To successfully develop such a system, the capability of autonomously identifying other ships and evaluating their associated encountering situation is of paramount importance. In this paper, we aim to identify ships’ encounter situation modes using deep learning methods based upon the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. First, a segmentation process is developed to divide each ship’s AIS data into different segments that contain only one encounter situation mode. This is different to the majority of studies that have proposed encounter situation mode classification using hand-crafted features, which may not reflect the actual ship’s movement states. Furthermore, a number of present classification tasks are conducted using substantial labelled AIS data followed by a supervised training paradigm, which is not applicable to our dataset as it contains a large number of unlabelled AIS data. Therefore, a method called SemiSupervised Convolutional Encoder–Decoder Network (SCEDN) for ship encounter situation classification based on AIS data is proposed. The structure of the network is not only able to automatically extract features from AIS segments but also share training parameters for the unlabelled data. The SCEDN uses an encoder–decoder convolutional structure with four channels for each segment (distance, speed, Time to the Closed Point of Approach (TCPA) and Distance to the Closed Point of Approach (DCPA)) been developed. The performance of the SCEDN model are evaluated by comparing to several baselines with the experimental results demonstrating a higher accuracy can be achieved by our proposed model.",,,,10.1016/j.oceaneng.2021.109824,,1-s2.0-S0029801821011823-main.pdf:/media/aweissen/ef6d006c-11d1-45ba-ad13-50a91575ccd91/projects/papers/anita/literatur_axel/1-s2.0-S0029801821011823-main.pdf:application/pdf,,,298018,Ocean Engineering,,en,nov,,,109824,,,,https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0029801821011823,2023-06-18,239.0,2021.0,Next location / final destination prediction,Convolutional Encoder–Decoder Network,journal,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spatiotemporal graph neural networks have been widely used for this purpose, where a global graph structure is mainly used, but local graph features are ignored.

This study proposed a multi-scale adaptive spatiotemporal forecasting model called Adaptive SpatioTemporal InceptionNet (AST-InceptionNet). To enrich the captured features and extract multi-scale spatiotemporal ones, the inception part is applied to combine local spatiotemporal features with several global ones. Additionally, we developed a fully adaptive graph convolution method, including topologically adaptive graph convolution and an adaptive adjacency matrix.

It focuses on learning users’ sequential patterns of check-in behavior and on training personalized recommendation models using different types of contextual information. Unfortunately, most of the previous studies failed to incorporate the spatiotemporal contextual information, which plays a critical role in analyzing user check-in behavior, into recommending the next POI. In recent years, embedding learning and recurrent neural network (RNN) based approaches show promising performance for modeling sequential patterns of check-in behavior in next POI recommendation. However, not all of the historical check-in records contribute equally to the next-step check-in behavior. To provide better next POI recommendation performance, we ﬁrst proposed a spatiotemporal long and short-term memory (ST-LSTM) network. By feeding the spatiotemporal contextual information into the LSTM network in each step, ST-LSTM can model the spatial and temporal information better. Also, we developed an attention-based spatiotemporal LSTM (ATST-LSTM) network for next POI recommendation. By using the attention mechanism, ATST-LSTM can focus on the relevant historical check-in records in a check-in sequence selectively using the spatiotemporal contextual information.

The computation of vessel trajectory similarity has recently attracted increasing attention in the maritime data mining research community. However, traditional shape- and warping-based methods often suﬀer from several drawbacks such as high computational cost and sensitivity to unwanted artifacts and non-uniform sampling rates, etc. To eliminate these drawbacks, we propose an unsupervised learning method which automatically extracts low-dimensional features through a convolutional auto-encoder (CAE). In particular, we ﬁrst generate the informative trajectory images by remapping the raw vessel trajectories into two-dimensional matrices while maintaining the spatio-temporal properties. Based on the massive vessel trajectories collected, the CAE can learn the low-dimensional representations of informative trajectory images in an unsupervised manner. The trajectory similarity is ﬁnally equivalent to eﬃciently computing the similarities between the learned low-dimensional features, which strongly correlate with the raw vessel trajectories. Comprehensive experiments on realistic data sets have demonstrated that the proposed method largely outperforms traditional trajectory similarity computation methods in terms of eﬃciency and eﬀectiveness.

Most existing methods only consider the ﬁxed time and space between successive check-in points when capturing sequential patterns from trajectory history. However, single granularity is inadequate to mine the spatial-temporal inﬂuence on sequential patterns in sparse and incomplete check-in data.

The problem is important in reducing trafﬁc congestion, improving public transportation efﬁciency, and facilitating urban planning.

In this paper, we tackle the challenges by proposing a novel Complex-ConditionControlled Generative Adversarial Network (C3-GAN) for urban trafﬁc estimation of a region under various complex conditions. C3-GAN features the following three novel designs on top of standard cGAN model: (1) an embedding network mapping the complex conditions to a latent space to ﬁnd representations of the urban conditions; (2) an inference network to enhance the relations between the embedded latent vectors and the trafﬁc data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our C3-GAN produces high-quality trafﬁc estimations and outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods.","Auckland, New Zealand",,2021 {IEEE} {International} {Conference} on {Data} {Mining} ({ICDM}),10.1109/ICDM51629.2021.00196,,C3-GAN_Complex-Condition-Controlled_Urban_Traffic_Estimation_through_Generative_Adversarial_Networks.pdf:/media/aweissen/ef6d006c-11d1-45ba-ad13-50a91575ccd91/projects/papers/anita/literatur_axel/C3-GAN_Complex-Condition-Controlled_Urban_Traffic_Estimation_through_Generative_Adversarial_Networks.pdf:application/pdf,,978-1-66542-398-4,,,,en,dec,,,1505--1510,IEEE,C $^{\textrm{3}}$ -{GAN},,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9679030/,2023-06-18,,2021.0,Traffic volume prediction,GAN,article,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although many previous works have studied the problem of trajectory generation, the continuity of the generated trajectories has been neglected, which makes these methods useless for practical urban simulation scenarios. To solve this problem, we propose a novel twostage generative adversarial framework to generate the continuous trajectory on the road network, namely TS-TrajGen, which efﬁciently integrates prior domain knowledge of human mobility with model-free learning paradigm. Speciﬁcally, we build the generator under the human mobility hypothesis of the A* algorithm to learn the human mobility behavior. For the discriminator, we combine the sequential reward with the mobility yaw reward to enhance the effectiveness of the generator.

For the purpose, we study the Diversified Continuous Trajectory Similarity Search (DCTSS) problem. The DCTSS problem aims to process a large number of Continuous Location Set (CLS) queries over a stream of trajectory data while taking result diversity of each query into consideration.

Recently, deep learning based approaches are proposed to learn the spatiotemporal characteristics of the trafﬁc passenger ﬂows. However, it is still very challenging to handle some complex factors such as hybrid transportation lines, mixed trafﬁc, transfer stations, and some extreme weathers. Considering the multi-channel and irregularity properties of urban trafﬁc passenger ﬂows in different transportation lines, a more efﬁcient and ﬁne-grained deep spatio-temporal feature learning model is necessary. In this paper, we propose a deep irregular convolutional residual LSTM network model called DST-ICRL for urban trafﬁc passenger ﬂows prediction. We ﬁrst model the passenger ﬂows among different trafﬁc lines in a transportation network into multi-channel matrices analogous to the RGB pixel matrices of an image. Then, we propose a deep learning framework that integrates irregular convolutional residential network and LSTM units to learn the spatial-temporal feature representations. To fully utilize the historical passenger ﬂows, we sample both the short-term and long-term historical trafﬁc data, which can capture the periodicity and trend of the trafﬁc passenger ﬂows. In addition, we also fuse other external factors further to facilitate a real-time prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on different types of trafﬁc passenger ﬂows datasets including subway, taxi and bus ﬂows in Beijing as well as bike ﬂows in New York.

In this work, we explore deep learning strategies using historical AIS observations to address the problem of predicting future vessel trajectories with a prediction horizon of several hours. We propose novel sequence-tosequence vessel trajectory prediction models based on encoderdecoder recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that are trained on historical trajectory data to predict future trajectory samples given previous observations. The proposed architecture combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) RNNs for sequence modeling to encode the observed data and generate future predictions with different intermediate aggregation layers to capture spacetime dependencies in sequential data. Experimental results on vessel trajectories from an AIS dataset made freely available by the Danish Maritime Authority show the effectiveness of deeplearning methods for trajectory prediction based on sequenceto-sequence neural networks, which achieve better performance than baseline approaches based on linear regression or on the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architecture. The comparative evaluation of results shows: i) the superiority of attention pooling over static pooling for the speciﬁc application, and ii) the remarkable performance improvement that can be obtained with labeled trajectories, i.e., when predictions are conditioned on a low-level context representation encoded from the sequence of past observations, as well as on additional inputs (e.g., port of departure or arrival) about the vessel’s high-level intention which may be available from AIS.",,"Comment: Accepted for publications in IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, 17 pages, 9 figures",,10.1109/TAES.2021.3096873,,2101.02486.pdf:/media/aweissen/ef6d006c-11d1-45ba-ad13-50a91575ccd91/projects/papers/anita/literatur_axel/2101.02486.pdf:application/pdf,,,"0018-9251, 1557-9603, 2371-9877",IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,en,dec,arXiv:2101.02486 [cs],6.0,4329--4346,,,,http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02486,2023-06-18,57.0,2021.0,Trajectory prediction/imputation,LSTM,arxiv,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
kim_deep_2018,article,"Kim, Kwang-Il and Lee, Keon",Deep Learning-Based Caution Area Traffic Prediction with Automatic Identification System Sensor Data,"In a crowded harbor water area, it is a major concern to control ship trafﬁc for assuring safety and maximizing the efﬁciency of port operations. Vessel Trafﬁc Service (VTS) operators pay much attention to caution areas like ship route intersections or trafﬁc congestion area in which there are some risks of ship collision. They want to control the trafﬁc of the caution area at a proper level to lessen risk. Inertial ship movement makes swift changes in direction and speed difﬁcult. It is hence important to predict future trafﬁc of the caution area earlier on so as to get enough time for control actions on ship movements. In the harbor area, VTS stations collect a large volume of Automatic Identiﬁcation Service (AIS) sensor data, which contain information about ship movement and ship attributes. This paper proposes a new deep neural network model called Ship Trafﬁc Extraction Network (STENet) to predict the medium-term trafﬁc and long-term trafﬁc of the caution area. The STENet model is trained with AIS sensor data. The STENet model is organized into a hierarchical architecture in which the outputs of the movement and contextual feature extraction modules are concatenated and fed into a prediction module. The movement module extracts the features of overall ship movements with a convolutional neural network. The contextual modules consist of ﬁve separated fully-connected neural networks, each of which receives an associated attribute. The separation of feature extraction modules at the front phase helps extract the effective features by preventing unrelated attributes from crosstalking. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, the developed model is applied to a real AIS sensor dataset, which has been collected over two years at a Korean port called Yeosu. In the experiments, four methods have been compared including two new methods: STENet and VGGNet-based models. For the real AIS sensor dataset, the proposed model has shown 50.65\% relative performance improvement on average for the medium-term predictions and 57.65\% improvement on average for the long-term predictions over the benchmark method, i.e., the SVR-based method.",,,,10.3390/s18093172,,sensors-18-03172.pdf:/media/aweissen/ef6d006c-11d1-45ba-ad13-50a91575ccd91/projects/papers/anita/literatur_axel/sensors-18-03172.pdf:application/pdf,,,1424-8220,Sensors,,en,sep,,9.0,3172,,,,http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/18/9/3172,2023-06-18,18.0,2018.0,Traffic volume prediction,CNN,article,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, trafﬁc prediction is a very challenging problem because trafﬁc data are a typical type of spatio-temporal data, which simultaneously shows correlation and heterogeneity both in space and time. Most existing works can only capture the partial properties of trafﬁc data and even assume that the effect of correlation on trafﬁc prediction is globally invariable, resulting in inadequate modeling and unsatisfactory prediction performance. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning model, called ST-3DNet, for trafﬁc raster data prediction. ST-3DNet introduces 3D convolutions to automatically capture the correlations of trafﬁc data in both spatial and temporal dimensions. A novel recalibration (Rc) block is proposed to explicitly quantify the difference of the contributions of the correlations in space. Considering two kinds of temporal properties of trafﬁc data, i.e., local patterns and long-term patterns, ST-3DNet employs two components consisting of 3D convolutions and Rc blocks to, respectively, model the two kinds of patterns and then aggregates them together in a weighted way for the ﬁnal prediction.

However, predicting mobility is not trivial because of three challenges: 1) the complex sequential transition regularities exhibited with time-dependent and highorder nature; 2) the multi-level periodicity of human mobility; and 3) the heterogeneity and sparsity of the collected trajectory data. In this paper, we propose DeepMove, an attentional recurrent network for mobility prediction from lengthy and sparse trajectories. In DeepMove, we first design a multi-modal embedding recurrent neural network to capture the complicated sequential transitions by jointly embedding the multiple factors that govern the human mobility. Then, we propose a historical attention model with two mechanisms to capture the multi-level periodicity in a principle way, which effectively utilizes the periodicity nature to augment the recurrent neural network for mobility prediction. We perform experiments on three representative real-life mobility datasets, and extensive evaluation results demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art models by more than 10\%.

The past decade has witnessed the success of deep learning in processing image, voice and text data. However, its application in movement pattern detection is not fully exploited. To address the research gap, this paper develops a deep learning approach to detect regional dominant movement patterns (RDMP) in trajectory data. Speciﬁcally, a novel feature descriptor called directional ﬂow image (DFI) is ﬁrstly proposed to store the local directional movement information in trajectory data. A DFI classiﬁcation model called TRNet is designed based on convolutional neural network. The model is then trained with a synthetic trajectory dataset covering 11 classes of commonly encountered movement patterns in reality. Finally, a sliding window detector is built to detect RDMP at multiple scales and a clustering-based merging method is proposed to prune the redundant detection results.

Nonetheless, GPS trajectories comprise personal geo-location information, rendering inevitable privacy concerns on plain data. One promising solution to this problem is trajectory generation, replacing the original data with the generated privacy-free ones. However, owing to the complex and stochastic behavior of human activities, generating high-quality trajectories is still in its infancy. To achieve the objective, we propose a diffusion-based trajectory generation (Diff-Traj) framework, effectively integrating the generation capability of the diffusion model and learning from the spatial-temporal features of trajectories. Speciﬁcally, we gradually convert real trajectories to noise through a forward trajectory noising process. Then, Diff-Traj reconstructs forged trajectories from the noise by a reverse trajectory denoising process. In addition, we design a trajectory UNet (Traj-UNet) structure to extract trajectory features for noise level prediction during the reverse process.

The goal of next location recommendation is to predict the next point-of-interest a user might go to based on the user’s historical trajectory. Most existing models learn mobility patterns merely from users’ historical check-in sequences while overlooking the signiﬁcance of user preference modeling. In this work, a novel Point-of-Interest Transformer (POIFormer) with contrastive user preference modeling is developed for end-to-end next location recommendation. This model consists of three major modules: history encoder, query generator, and preference decoder. History encoder is designed to model mobility patterns from historical check-in sequences, while query generator explicitly learns user preferences to generate user-speciﬁc intention queries. Finally, preference decoder combines the intention queries and historical information to predict the user’s next location. Extensive comparisons with representative schemes and ablation studies on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed scheme under various settings.",,,,,,2303.12507.pdf:/media/aweissen/ef6d006c-11d1-45ba-ad13-50a91575ccd91/projects/papers/anita/literatur_axel/2303.12507.pdf:application/pdf,,,,,Computer Science - Information Retrieval,en,mar,arXiv:2303.12507 [cs],,,arXiv,,,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12507,2023-06-18,,2023.0,Next location / final destination prediction,"POIFormer, i.e., history encoder,

These three methods use very different ideas on determining the weights of individual models for integration. To evaluate the performances of these three EWMs, this study applied them to developing integrated short-term trafﬁc ﬂow prediction models for signalized intersections. At ﬁrst, two individual models, i.e., a k-nearest neighbors (KNN)-algorithm-based model and a neural-network-based model (Elman), were developed as individual models to be integrated using EWMs. These two models were selected because they have been widely used for trafﬁc ﬂow prediction and have been approved to be able to achieve good performance. After that, three integrated models were developed by using the three different types of EWMs. The performances of the three integrated models, as well as the individual KNN and Elman models, were compared. We found that the trafﬁc ﬂow predicted with the EWM-C model is the most accurate prediction for most of the days.

ali_exploiting_2022,article,"Ali, Ahmad and Zhu, Yanmin and Zakarya, Muhammad",Exploiting dynamic spatio-temporal graph convolutional neural networks for citywide traffic flows prediction,"The prediction of crowd flows is an important urban computing issue whose purpose is to predict the future number of incoming and outgoing people in regions. Measuring the complicated spatial–temporal dependencies with external factors, such as weather conditions and surrounding point-of-interest (POI) distribution is the most difficult aspect of predicting crowd flows movement. To overcome the above issue, this paper advises a unified dynamic deep spatio-temporal neural network model based on convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory, termed as (DHSTNet) to simultaneously predict crowd flows in every region of a city. The DHSTNet model is made up of four separate components: a recent, daily, weekly, and an external branch component. Our proposed approach simultaneously assigns various weights to different branches and integrates the four properties’ outputs to generate final predictions. Moreover, to verify the generalization and scalability of the proposed model, we apply a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) with the previously published model, termed as GCN-DHSTNet; to capture the spatial patterns and short-term temporal features; and to illustrate its exceptional accomplishment in predicting the traffic crowd flows. The GCN-DHSTNet model not only depicts the spatio-temporal dependencies but also reveals the influence of different time granularity, which are recent, daily, weekly periodicity and external properties, respectively. Finally, a fully connected neural network is utilized to fuse the spatio-temporal features and external properties together. Using two different real-world traffic datasets, our evaluation suggests that the proposed GCN-DHSTNet method is approximately 7.9\%–27.2\% and 11.2\%–11.9\% better than the AAtt-DHSTNet method in terms of RMSE and MAPE metrics, respectively.

Due to the privacy concerns and rigorous data regulations, federated learning provides a distributed learning framework to collaboratively train the HMP model without sharing the highly sensitive location data with others. However, in real-world scenarios, federated human mobility prediction suffers from data heterogeneity challenge, which includes two main aspects: heterogeneity mobility patterns, and data scarcity. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end federated representation learning framework for human mobility prediction, named FR-HMP, to overcome all the above obstacles. Specially, in order to enhance the representation abilities of data-scarcity clients, a two-phase learning process is proposed. The clustering module could cluster similar clients together on the parameter server to address the heterogeneous mobility patterns, and the representation learning module learns the enhanced representations of each client through the graph learning layer and graph convolution layer on the third-part server. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted using two diverse real-world HMP datasets to show the advantages of FR-HMP over state-of-the-art methods.",,,,10.1109/TITS.2023.3252029,,Federated_Representation_Learning_With_Data_Heterogeneity_for_Human_Mobility_Prediction.pdf:/media/aweissen/ef6d006c-11d1-45ba-ad13-50a91575ccd91/projects/papers/anita/2022/data/Federated_Representation_Learning_With_Data_Heterogeneity_for_Human_Mobility_Prediction.pdf:application/pdf,,,"1524-9050, 1558-0016",IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,,en,jun,,6.0,6111--6122,,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10074979/,2023-06-25,24.0,2023.0,Next location / final destination prediction,graph learning layer;  graph convolution layer,journal,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Considering the co-evolutionary patterns of crowd distribution, the interactions among places are essential for modelling crowd distribution variations. However, two issues remain. First, the lack of sampling design in passive big data acquisition makes the spatial interaction characterizations of less crowded places insufficient. Second, the multi-order spatial interactions among places can help forecasting crowd distribution but are rarely considered in the existing literature. To address these issues, a novel crowd distribution forecasting method with multiorder spatial interactions was proposed. In particular, a weighted random walk algorithm was applied to generate simulated trajectories for improving the interaction characterizations derived from sparse mobile phone data. The multi-order spatial interactions among contextual nonadjacent places were modelled with an embedding learning technique. The future crowd distri­ bution was forecasted via a graph-based deep neural network. The proposed method was verified using a real-world mobile phone dataset, and the results showed that both the multi-order spatial interactions and the trajectory data enhancement algorithm helped improve the crowd distri­ bution forecasting performance.

However, with increasing amount and heterogenity of group members, actual abnormal groups get harder to detect, especially in an unsupervised or semi-supervised setting. Recurrent Neural Networks are well established deep sequence models, but recent works have shown that their performance can decrease with increasing sequence lengths. Hence, we introduce with this paper GADFormer, a GAD speciﬁc BERT architecture, capable to perform attention-based Group Anomaly Detection on trajectories in an unsupervised and semi-supervised setting. We show formally and experimentally how trajectory outlier detection can be realized as an attention-based Group Anomaly Detection problem. Furthermore, we introduce a Block Attention-anomaly Score (BAS) to improve the interpretability of transformer encoder blocks for GAD.

To this end, we propose a Geographyaware sequential recommender based on the Self-Attention Network (GeoSAN for short) for location recommendation. On the one hand, we propose a new loss function based on importance sampling for optimization, to address the sparsity issue by emphasizing the use of informative negative samples. On the other hand, to make better use of geographical information, GeoSAN represents the hierarchical gridding of each GPS point with a self-attention based geography encoder. Moreover, we put forward geography-aware negative samplers to promote the informativeness of negative samples. We evaluate the proposed algorithm with three real-world LBSN datasets, and show that GeoSAN outperforms the state-of-theart sequential location recommenders by 34.9\%.

Our evaluation of the forecasting models shows that both GNN models outperform the two baseline models—Historical Average and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average—in terms of prediction performance.

Existing solutions for mobility simulation can be classified into two categories: model-based methods and model-free methods, which are both limited in generating high-quality mobility data due to the complicated transitions and complex regularities in human mobility. To solve this problem, we propose a modelfree generative adversarial framework, which effectively integrates the domain knowledge of human mobility regularity utilized in the model-based methods. In the proposed framework, we design a novel self-attention based sequential modeling network as the generator to capture the complicated temporal transitions in human mobility. To augment the learning power of the generator with the advantages of model-based methods, we design an attention-based region network to introduce the prior knowledge of urban structure to generate a meaningful trajectory. As for the discriminator, we design a mobility regularity-aware loss to distinguish the generated trajectory. Finally, we utilize the mobility regularities of spatial continuity and temporal periodicity to pre-train the generator and discriminator to further accelerate the learning procedure.

Furthermore, we utilize evidential deep learning classiﬁers to detect unusual turns of vessels and the loss of transmitted signal using predicted class probabilities with associated uncertainties. Our experimental results suggest that the graphical representation of trafﬁc patterns improves the ability of the DL models, such as evidential and Monte Carlo dropout, to learn the temporalspatial correlation of data and associated uncertainties.

yang_location_2020,inproceedings,"Yang, Dingqi and Fankhauser, Benjamin and Rosso, Paolo and Cudre-Mauroux, Philippe",Location Prediction over Sparse User Mobility Traces Using RNNs: Flashback in Hidden States!,"Location prediction is a key problem in human mobility modeling, which predicts a user’s next location based on historical user mobility traces. As a sequential prediction problem by nature, it has been recently studied using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Due to the sparsity of user mobility traces, existing techniques strive to improve RNNs by considering spatiotemporal contexts. The most adopted scheme is to incorporate spatiotemporal factors into the recurrent hidden state passing process of RNNs using context-parameterized transition matrices or gates. However, such a scheme oversimpliﬁes the temporal periodicity and spatial regularity of user mobility, and thus cannot fully beneﬁt from rich historical spatiotemporal contexts encoded in user mobility traces. Against this background, we propose Flashback, a general RNN architecture designed for modeling sparse user mobility traces by doing ﬂashbacks on hidden states in RNNs. Speciﬁcally, Flashback explicitly uses spatiotemporal contexts to search past hidden states with high predictive power (i.e., historical hidden states sharing similar contexts as the current one) for location prediction, which can then directly beneﬁt from rich spatiotemporal contexts. Our extensive evaluation compares Flashback against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art techniques on two real-world LBSN datasets. Results show that Flashback consistently and signiﬁcantly outperforms state-of-the-art RNNs involving spatiotemporal factors by 15.9\% to 27.6\% in the next location prediction task.","Yokohama, Japan",,Proceedings of the {Twenty}-{Ninth} {International} {Joint} {Conference} on {Artificial} {Intelligence},10.24963/ijcai.2020/302,,2020_Cudre-Mauroux_Location.pdf:/media/aweissen/ef6d006c-11d1-45ba-ad13-50a91575ccd91/projects/papers/anita/2022/data/2020_Cudre-Mauroux_Location.pdf:application/pdf,,978-0-9992411-6-5,,,,en,jul,,,2184--2190,International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence Organization,Location {Prediction} over {Sparse} {User} {Mobility} {Traces} {Using} {RNNs},,https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/302,2023-06-25,,2020.0,Next location / final destination prediction,RNN,article,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Existing location prediction methods have achieved remarkable development in centrally stored datasets. However, these datasets contain privacy data about user behaviors and may cause privacy issues. A location prediction method is proposed in our work to predict human movement behavior using federated learning techniques in which the data are stored in different clients and different clients cooperate to train to extract useful users’ behavior information and prevent the disclosure of privacy information.

However, existing methods rarely consider the underlying dynamics knowledge and directly use machine learning algorithms to predict the trajectories. Intuitively, the vessel’s motions are following the laws of dynamics, e.g., the speed of a vessel decreases when turning a corner. Yet, it is challenging to combine dynamic knowledge and neural networks due to their inherent heterogeneity. Against this background, we propose MSTFormer, a motion inspired vessel trajectory prediction method based on Transformer. The contribution of this work is threefold. First, we design a data augmentation method to describe the spatial features and motion features of the trajectory. Second, we propose a Multi-headed Dynamic-aware Self-attention mechanism to focus on trajectory points with frequent motion transformations. Finally, we construct a knowledge-inspired loss function to further boost the performance of the model. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that our strategy not only effectively improves long-term predictive capability but also outperforms backbones on cornering data. The ablation analysis further conﬁrms the efﬁcacy of the proposed method. To the best of our knowledge, MSTFormer is the ﬁrst neural network model for trajectory prediction fused with vessel motion dynamics, providing a worthwhile direction for future research.

However, most existing methods require the target city to provide a large amount of traffic data. Once traffic estimation is performed in a “new” city where many urban services and transportation infrastructures are not built and thus no prior data is available, those works would fail due to the lack of data. In this paper, we aim to solve the conditional urban traffic estimation problem in case of data scarcity (i.e., the target city cannot provide any prior data) and tackle the main challenges including (1) knowledge learning from the source and (2) knowledge adaptation without prior traffic data. We propose a novel generative adversarial network —Meta Spatial-Temporal Generative Adversarial Network (MestGAN), which can successfully estimate traffic in the target city based on local travel demands without the access to any prior traffic data. To address the first challenge, we learn the latent distribution of travel demands with the inference network, the latent distribution also indicates the diverse spatial-temporal traffic patterns. To solve the second challenge, we use the travel demand data in the target city for adaptation, where the inference network infers a latent code guiding the generator to produce accurate traffic estimations.

However, due to the sparsity of mobility data, it is not an easy task to predict future POIs (place-of-interests) that are going to be visited. In this paper, we propose MobTCast, a Transformer-based context-aware network for mobility prediction. Speciﬁcally, we explore the inﬂuence of four types of context in mobility prediction: temporal, semantic, social, and geographical contexts. We ﬁrst design a base mobility feature extractor using the Transformer architecture, which takes both the history POI sequence and the semantic information as input. It handles both the temporal and semantic contexts. Based on the base extractor and the social connections of a user, we employ a self-attention module to model the inﬂuence of the social context. Furthermore, unlike existing methods, we introduce a location prediction branch in MobTCast as an auxiliary task to model the geographical context and predict the next location. Intuitively, the geographical distance between the location of the predicted POI and the predicted location from the auxiliary branch should be as close as possible. To reﬂect this relation, we design a consistency loss to further improve the POI prediction performance. In our experimental results, MobTCast outperforms other state-of-the-art next POI prediction methods.

How can we model the human mobility consisting of stay and travel from the raw trajectory data? How can we infer such a mobility model from the single trajectory information? How can we further generalize the mobility inference to accommodate the real-world trajectory data that is sparsely sampled over time? In this paper, based on formal and rigid deﬁnitions of the stay/travel mobility, we propose a single trajectory inference algorithm that utilizes a generic long-tailed sparsity pattern in the large-scale trajectory data. The algorithm guarantees a 100\% precision in the stay/travel inference with a provable lowerbound in the recall. Furthermore, we introduce an encoderdecoder learning architecture that admits multiple trajectories as inputs. The architecture is optimized for the mobility inference problem through customized embedding and learning mechanism. Evaluations with three trajectory data sets of 40 million urban users validate the performance guarantees of the proposed inference algorithm and demonstrate the superiority of our deep learning model, in comparison to well-known sequence learning methods.

jiang_modeling_2023,article,"Jiang, Shaowei and He, Wei and Cui, Lizhen and Xu, Yonghui and Liu, Lei",Modeling Long- and Short-Term User Preferences via Self-Supervised Learning for Next POI Recommendation,"With the accumulation of check-in data from location-based services, next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendations are gaining increasing attention. It is well known that the spatio-temporal contextual information of user check-in behavior plays a crucial role in handling vital and inherent challenges in next POI recommendation, including capture of user dynamic preferences and the sparsity problem of check-in data. However, many studies either ignore or simply stack the context features with the embedding of POIs while relying only on POI recommendation loss to optimize the entire model, therefore failing to take full advantage of the potential information in contexts. Additionally, users’ interests are usually unstable and evolve over time, and accordingly recent studies have proposed various approaches to predict users’ next POIs by incorporating contextual information and modeling both their long- and short-term preferences, respectively. Yet many studies overemphasize the final POI recommendation performance, and the association between POI sequences and contextual information is not well embodied in data representations. In this article, we focus on the preceding problems and propose a unified attention framework for next POI recommendation by modeling users’ Long- and Short-term Preferences via Self-supervised Learning (LSPSL). Specifically, based on the self-attention network and two self-supervised optimization objectives, LSPSL first deeply exploits the intrinsic correlations between POI sequences and contextual information through pre-training, which strengthens data representations. Then, supported by pre-trained contextualized embeddings, LSPSL models and fuses users’ complex long- and short-term preferences in a unified way.

jia_motion_2022,article,"Jia, Chengfeng and Ma, Jie and He, Murong and Su, Yudong and Zhang, Yu and Yu, Qing",Motion primitives learning of ship-ship interaction patterns in encounter situations,"Understanding the ship encounter situations is a tough task, since the uncertain motions of encountering ships and the long-lasting frequent interactions make the encounter processes dynamic and stochastic. If we can decompose these complex encounter processes into motion primitives, which represent the elementary inter­ action patterns, an encounter can be more easily understood and identified. In this study, we propose a twostream Long Short-Term Memory-based autoencoder (LSTM-based AE) approach to extract motion primitives from multi-dimensional encounter data without specific rules and prior knowledge. This approach leverages the sequential representation ability of LSTM to learn the temporal dependencies of each encountering ship motion. Then, we developed a fusion gate named dynamic artificial potential field (DAPF) to fuse the outputs of two LSTMs and generated the high-level representation needed to capture the spatiotemporal relationships of the interactions. After that, through a clustering method, the motion primitives were automatically extracted to describe various interaction patterns. The effectiveness of this approach was validated by naturalistic encounter data. The low reconstruction errors of the LSTM-based AE demonstrated that high-level representations captured the relationships of the interactions in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Case studies demonstrated that the utilization of motion primitives provided a semantically interpretable technique to analyze the interaction patterns and encounter process, which is conducive to situation awareness and decision-making for developing intelligent ships.",,,,10.1016/j.oceaneng.2022.110708,,1-s2.0-S0029801822001603-main.pdf:/media/aweissen/ef6d006c-11d1-45ba-ad13-50a91575ccd91/projects/papers/anita/literatur_axel/1-s2.0-S0029801822001603-main.pdf:application/pdf,,,298018,Ocean Engineering,,en,mar,,,110708,,,,https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0029801822001603,2023-06-18,247.0,2022.0,Trajectory prediction/imputation,LSTM,journal,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the Automatic Identiﬁcation System (AIS) has provided a new opportunity for researchers to tackle this problem by offering a large database of dynamic and geo-spatial information of marine vessels. With the availability of such large databases, researchers can now develop sophisticated models and algorithms that leverage the increased availability of data to address the track association challenge effectively. Furthermore, with the advent of deep learning, track association can now be approached as a data-intensive problem. In this study, we propose a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based multi-model framework for track association. LSTM is a recurrent neural network architecture that is capable of processing multivariate temporal data collected over time in a sequential manner, enabling it to predict current vessel locations from historical observations. Based on these predictions, a geodesic distance based similarity metric is then utilized to associate the unclassiﬁed observations to their true tracks (vessels).

Therefore, this research focuses on the optimization problem of AIS and radar track association in dense scenes. Time-series data of tracks are transformed into the distribution features in a graph, which is free from the close dependence of the traditional algorithm on the pre-processing of the time alignment. To this end, an end-to-end deep network pipeline based on graph matching is proposed to overcome the influence of the above factors. It involves a multiscale point-level feature extractor to embed local features. Meanwhile, we devise a cluster-level graph neural network(GNN) with self-cross attention, which can look for global cues that help us disambiguate the correct correlation from complex tracks. Graph matching is estimated by tackling a differentiable optimal transport problem, which minimizes the transport cost and then achieves global optimal track association.

In recent years, mobility digital twin that makes a virtual replication of human mobility and predicting or simulating the fine-grained movements of the subjects in a virtual space at a metropolitan scale in near real-time has shown its great potential in modern urban intelligent systems. However, few studies have provided practical solutions. The main difficulties are four-folds. 1) The daily variation of human mobility is hard to model and predict; 2) the transportation network enforces a complex constraints on human mobility; 3) generating a rational fine-grained human trajectory is challenging for existing machine learning models; and 4) making a fine-grained prediction incurs high computational costs, which is challenging for an online system. Bearing these difficulties in mind, in this paper we propose a two-stage human mobility predictor that stratifies the coarse and fine-grained level predictions. In the first stage, to encode the daily variation of human mobility at a metropolitan level, we automatically extract citywide mobility trends as crowd contexts and predict long-term and long-distance movements at a coarse level. In the second stage, the coarse predictions are resolved to a fine-grained level via a probabilistic trajectory retrieval method, which offloads most of the heavy computations to the offline phase. We tested our method using a real-world mobile phone GPS dataset in the Kanto area in Japan, and achieved good prediction accuracy and a time efficiency of about 2 min in predicting future 1h movements of about 220K mobile phone users on a single machine to support more higher-level analysis of mobility prediction.",,,,,,2207.03575.pdf:/media/aweissen/ef6d006c-11d1-45ba-ad13-50a91575ccd91/projects/papers/anita/literatur_axel/2207.03575.pdf:application/pdf,,,,,"Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science - Social and Information Networks",en,jun,arXiv:2207.03575 [cs],,,arXiv,,,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03575,2023-06-18,,2022.0,Traffic volume prediction,GRU,arxiv,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, various deep learning methods, such as convolution neural network (CNN), have shown promising performance in trafﬁc prediction. However, it samples trafﬁc data in regular grids as the input of CNN, thus it destroys the spatial structure of the road network. In this paper, we introduce a graph network and propose an optimized graph convolution recurrent neural network for trafﬁc prediction, in which the spatial information of the road network is represented as a graph. Additionally, distinguishing with most current methods using a simple and empirical spatial graph, the proposed method learns an optimized graph through a data-driven way in the training phase, which reveals the latent relationship among the road segments from the trafﬁc data.

The goal is to recommend next POI for users at speciﬁc time given users’ historical check-in data. Therefore, it is crucial to model both users’ general taste and recent sequential behaviors. Moreover, different users show different dependencies on the two parts. However, most existing methods learn the same dependencies for different users. Besides, the locations and categories of POIs contain different information about users’ preference. However, current researchers always treat them as the same factors or believe that categories determine where to go. To this end, we propose a novel method named Personalized Long- and Short-term Preference Learning (PLSPL) to learn the speciﬁc preference for each user. Specially, we combine the long- and short-term preference via user-based linear combination unit to learn the personalized weights on different parts for different users. Besides, the context information such as the category and check-in time is also essential to capture users’ preference. Therefore, in long-term module, we consider the contextual features of POIs in users’ history records and leverage attention mechanism to capture users’ preference. In the short-term module, to better learn the different inﬂuences of locations and categories of POIs, we train two LSTM models for location- and category-based sequence, respectively. Then we evaluate the proposed model on two real-world datasets.

Among these challenges, historical patterns tend to be crucial in the prediction task. However, it is difﬁcult to capture complex patterns from long historical trajectories. Motivated by recent success of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based methods, we propose a Union ConvGRU (UCG) Net, which can capture long short-term patterns of historical trajectories and sequential impact of current trajectories. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst incorporate historical trajectories into hidden states by a shared-weight layer, and then utilize a 1D CNN to capture short-term pattern of hidden states. Next, an average pooling method is involved to generate separated hidden states of historical trajectories, on which we use a Fully Connected (FC) layer to capture longterm pattern subsequently.

Anomaly behaviour often carried out by ships sailing in Indonesian waters is to turn off AIS for a very long time. Ship identification is challenging for maritime inspectors to detect if the ship frequently turns off AIS during the voyage. Based on these problems, the researcher proposes to predict the ship's trajectory using historical AIS data. It is possible to predict ship trajectories based on AIS data to determine the trajectory of ships that turn off AIS. The results of the AIS trajectory are combined with the ship's trajectory, in general, to determine the trajectory with the ship's trajectory in general. A predicted ship trajectory that is not the same as the general route will be identified as an anomaly. Long Short Term Memory is proposed to predict ship trajectory using latitude, longitude, speed, and time parameters.

However, in maritime surveillance applications, reliably quantifying the prediction uncertainty can be as important as obtaining high accuracy. This paper extends deep learning frameworks for trajectory prediction tasks by exploring how recurrent encoder-decoder neural networks can be tasked not only to predict but also to yield a corresponding prediction uncertainty via Bayesian modeling of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties.

wang_shgcn_2022,inproceedings,"Wang, Yi and Zhu, Di",SHGCN: a hypergraph-based deep learning model for spatiotemporal traffic flow prediction,"Traffic flow prediction, as one of the prominent tasks in intelligent transportation systems, is challenging due to underlying complex spatiotemporal characteristics. Consideration of historical spatial and temporal dependencies is essential for the traffic prediction of a geographic unit for a future time period. Existing works mainly adopted graphs to represent the irregular layout of spatial units, where nodes are signal of spatial units and edges are link strengths between units. For contemporary deep learning based spatiotemporal prediction tasks, the temporal dependence can be well modeled via convolution neural network or recurrent neural network, and spatial dependence features are commonly captured using graph convolution networks. However, classic graph structures cannot fully represent the complex nature of spatial relationships in transportation networks, because the spatial pattern of a location might be influenced by multiple sets of contextual information simultaneously, while a graph edge can only describe the linkage between two nodes. In addition, most existing models ignore the synchronous dependence between temporal and spatial features, leading to a mismatch between the temporal and spatial features of a location. Based on such problems, a hypergraph-based deep learning model, namely synchronous hypergraph convolutional network (SHGCN), is proposed to better capture the complex relationships between spatial and temporal knowledge. A novel synchronous hypergraph cell (SH-Cell) is designed based on LSTM cells integrated in the form of a Seq2seq architecture. Then, we construct dynamic hypergraphs to capture the synchronous spatiotemporal dependence adaptively using SH-Cells. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of SHGCN over well-known benchmarks on two real-world publicly-available traffic datasets.

Current state-of-the-art models have attempted to solve spatial sparsity with hierarchical gridding and model temporal relation with explicit time intervals, while some vital questions remain unsolved. Non-adjacent locations and non-consecutive visits provide non-trivial correlations for understanding a user’s behavior but were rarely considered. To aggregate all relevant visits from user trajectory and recall the most plausible candidates from weighted representations, here we propose a Spatio-Temporal Attention Network (STAN) for location recommendation. STAN explicitly exploits relative spatiotemporal information of all the checkins with self-attention layers along the trajectory. This improvement allows a point-to-point interaction between non-adjacent locations and non-consecutive check-ins with explicit spatio-temporal effect. STAN uses a bi-layer attention architecture that firstly aggregates spatiotemporal correlation within user trajectory and then recalls the target with consideration of personalized item frequency (PIF).

Conventional methods for conditional trafﬁc estimation usually focus on supervised settings, which require a large amount of labeled training data. However, in many urban planning applications, the large amount of trafﬁc data in a new city can be hard or impossible to acquire. To tackle the conditional trafﬁc estimation problem in data scarcity situations, we formulate the problem as a spatial transfer generative learning problem. Compared to prior spatial transfer learning frameworks with only single source city, we propose to extracts knowledge from multiple source cities to improve the estimation accuracy and transfer stability, which is a technically more challenging task. As a solution, we propose a new cross-city conditional trafﬁc estimation method — SpatiallyTransferable Generative Adversarial Networks (STrans-GAN) with novel pre-training and ﬁne-tuning algorithms. STransGAN preserves diverse trafﬁc patterns from multiple source cities through trafﬁc clustering, and incorporates meta-learning idea into the pre-training process to learn a well-generalized model.

Therefore, the tracking and monitoring of ships at sea has gradually attracted the attention of scholars. Ship trajectory prediction comprises an important aspect of ship tracking and monitoring. Trajectory prediction describes the forecasting of a ship’s future trajectory over a period of time through use of historical trajectory information of the ship, so as to predict the sailing dynamics of the ship in advance. Accurate trajectory prediction can help maritime regulatory authorities improve supervision efﬁciency and reduce collisions between ships.

Ship trajectory sequence belongs to the category of time series. Thus, in this paper, we introduce TCN into the ﬁeld of ship trajectory prediction and improve on it, and propose Tiered-TCN (TTCN).

Various deep learning techniques are developed to model the traffic dynamic patterns with different neural network architectures, such as attention mechanism, recurrent neural network. However, two important challenges have yet to be well addressed: (i) Most of these methods solely focus on local spatial dependencies and ignore the global inter-region dependencies in terms of traffic distributions; (ii) It is important to capture channel-aware semantics when performing spatial-temporal information aggregation. To address these challenges, we propose a new traffic prediction framework–Spatial-Temporal Convolutional Graph Attention Network (ST-CGA), to enable the traffic prediction with the modeling of region dependencies, from locally to globally in a comprehensive manner. In our ST-CGA framework, we first develop a hierarchical attention networks with a graph-based neural architecture, to capture both the multi-level temporal relations and cross-region traffic dependencies. Furthermore, a region-wise spatial relation encoder is proposed to supercharge ST-CGA mapping spatial and temporal signals into different representation subspaces, with channel-aware recalibration residual network.

The state-of-the-art traffic flow prediction models can effectively extract both spatial and temporal features of traffic flow data, but ignore the correlation and external interference between traffic nodes. To this end, this paper proposes a novel method based on Spatial–Temporal Complex Graph Convolution Network (ST-CGCN) for traffic flow prediction. Specifically, we first constructs the distance matrix, the data correlation matrix, and the comfort measurement matrix according to the geographical locations, the historical data record, and the external interference between traffic nodes. Then, these three matrices are fused into a complex correlation matrix by introducing self-learning dynamic weights to improve the joint modeling ability of spatial–temporal features and external factors. Next, a spatial feature extraction module and a temporal feature extraction module are designed to characterize dynamic spatial–temporal features. The spatial feature extraction module consists of a graph convolution operator with a proposed complex correlation matrix and a residual unit.

Due to the high nonlinearity and complexity of trafﬁc ﬂow, traditional methods cannot satisfy the requirements of mid-and-long term prediction tasks and often neglect spatial and temporal dependencies. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework, Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (STGCN), to tackle the time series prediction problem in trafﬁc domain. Instead of applying regular convolutional and recurrent units, we formulate the problem on graphs and build the model with complete convolutional structures, which enable much faster training speed with fewer parameters.

First, trafﬁc data are physically associated with road networks, and thus should be formatted as trafﬁc graphs rather than regular grid-like tensors. Second, trafﬁc data render strong spatial dependence, which implies that the nodes in the trafﬁc graphs usually have complex and dynamic relationships between each other. Third, trafﬁc data demonstrate strong temporal dependence, which is crucial for trafﬁc time series modeling. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework named Structure Learning Convolution (SLC) that enables to extend the traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) to graph domains and learn the graph structure for trafﬁc forecasting. Technically, SLC explicitly models the structure information into the convolutional operation. Under this framework, various non-Euclidean CNN methods can be considered as particular instances of our formulation, yielding a ﬂexible mechanism for learning on the graph. Along this technical line, two SLC modules are proposed to capture the global and local structures respectively and they are integrated to construct an endto-end network for trafﬁc forecasting. Additionally, in this process, Pseudo three Dimensional convolution (P3D) networks are combined with SLC to capture the temporal dependencies in trafﬁc data.

Accurate prediction result is the precondition of traffic guidance, management, and control. To improve the prediction accuracy, a spatiotemporal traffic flow prediction method is proposed combined with k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and long short-term memory network (LSTM), which is called KNN-LSTM model in this paper. KNN is used to select mostly related neighboring stations with the test station and capture spatial features of traffic flow.

The final prediction results are obtained by result-level fusion with rank-exponent weighting method. The prediction performance is evaluated with real-time traffic flow data provided by the Transportation Research Data Lab (TDRL) at the University of Minnesota Duluth (UMD) Data Center.

cui_stacked_2020,article,"Cui, Zhiyong and Ke, Ruimin and Pu, Ziyuan and Wang, Yinhai",Stacked bidirectional and unidirectional LSTM recurrent neural network for forecasting network-wide traffic state with missing values,"Short-term traffic forecasting based on deep learning methods, especially recurrent neural networks (RNN), has received much attention in recent years. However, the potential of RNN-based models in traffic forecasting has not yet been fully exploited in terms of the predictive power of spatial–temporal data and the capability of handling missing data. In this paper, we focus on RNN-based models and attempt to reformulate the way to incorporate RNN and its variants into traffic prediction models. A stacked bidirectional and unidirectional LSTM network architecture (SBU-LSTM) is proposed to assist the design of neural network structures for traffic state forecasting. As a key component of the architecture, the bidirectional LSTM (BDLSM) is exploited to capture the forward and backward temporal dependencies in spatiotemporal data. To deal with missing values in spatial–temporal data, we also propose a data imputation mechanism in the LSTM structure (LSTM-I) by designing an imputation unit to infer missing values and assist traffic prediction. The bidirectional version of LSTM-I is incorporated in the SBU-LSTM architecture. Two real-world network-wide traffic state datasets are used to conduct experiments and published to facilitate further traffic prediction research. The prediction performance of multiple types of multi-layer LSTM or BDLSTM models is evaluated. Experimental results indicate that the proposed SBU-LSTM architecture, especially the two-layer BDLSTM network, can achieve superior performance for the network-wide traffic prediction in both accuracy and robustness. Further, comprehensive comparison results show that the proposed data imputation mechanism in the RNN-based models can achieve outstanding prediction performance when the model’s input data contains different patterns of missing values.",,,,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102674,,1-s2.0-S0968090X20305891-main.pdf:/media/aweissen/ef6d006c-11d1-45ba-ad13-50a91575ccd91/projects/papers/anita/2022/data/1-s2.0-S0968090X20305891-main.pdf:application/pdf,,,0968090X,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,,en,sep,,,102674,,,,https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0968090X20305891,2023-06-25,118.0,2020.0,Traffic volume prediction,LSTM,journal,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
khaled_tfgan_2022,article,"Khaled, Alkilane and Elsir, Alfateh M. Tag and Shen, Yanming",TFGAN: Traffic forecasting using generative adversarial network with multi-graph convolutional network,"Traffic forecasting constitutes a task of great importance in intelligent transport systems. Owing to the non-Euclidean structure of traffic data, the complicated spatial correlations, and the dynamic temporal dependencies, it is challenging to predict traffic accurately. Despite the fact that few prior studies have considered the interconnections between multiple traffic nodes at the same timestep, the majority of studies fail to capture the dependencies among multiple nodes at different timesteps. Furthermore, most existing work generates shallow graphs based solely on the distance between traffic nodes, which limits their representation competence and declines their power in capturing complex correlations. In particular, inspired by the recent breakthroughs in the generative adversarial network (GAN) and the power of the graph convolution network (GCN) in handling non-Euclidean data, this paper puts forward an adversarial multi-graph convolutional neural network model, named TFGAN, to address the abovementioned problems. We integrate the unsupervised model elasticity with the supervision provided by supervised training to help the GAN generator model generates accurate traffic predictions. To improve the representation and model the implicit correlations effectively, multiple GCNs are constructed within the generator based on various perspectives, such as similarity, correlation, and spatial distance. Meanwhile, GRU and self-attention are applied after each graph to capture the dynamic temporal dependencies across nodes. The comprehensive experiments on three different traffic variables (traffic flow, speed, and travel time) using six real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that TFGAN outperforms the related state-of-the-art models and achieves significant results.",,,,10.1016/j.knosys.2022.108990,,1-s2.0-S0950705122004804-main.pdf:/media/aweissen/ef6d006c-11d1-45ba-ad13-50a91575ccd91/projects/papers/anita/literatur_axel/1-s2.0-S0950705122004804-main.pdf:application/pdf,,,9507051,Knowledge-Based Systems,,en,aug,,,108990,,{TFGAN},,https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0950705122004804,2023-06-18,249.0,2022.0,Traffic volume prediction,generative adversarial network (GAN) and graph convolution network (GCN),journal,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This task is challenging due to the complex spatial and temporal correlations (e.g., the constraints of road network and the law of dynamic change with time). Existing work tried to solve this problem by exploiting a variety of spatiotemporal models. However, we observe that more semantic pair-wise correlations among possibly distant roads are also critical for trafﬁc ﬂow prediction. To jointly model the spatial, temporal, semantic correlations with various global features in the road network, this paper proposes T-MGCN (Temporal Multi-Graph Convolutional Network), a deep learning framework for trafﬁc ﬂow prediction. First, we identify several kinds of semantic correlations, and encode the nonEuclidean spatial correlations and heterogeneous semantic correlations among roads into multiple graphs. These correlations are then modeled by a multi-graph convolutional network. Second, a recurrent neural network is utilized to learn dynamic patterns of trafﬁc ﬂow to capture the temporal correlations. Third, a fully connected neural network is utilized to fuse the spatiotemporal correlations with global features. We evaluate T-MGCN on two real-world trafﬁc datasets and observe improvement by approximately 3\% to 6\% as compared to the state-of-the-art baseline.",,,,10.1109/TITS.2020.2983763,,Temporal_Multi-Graph_Convolutional_Network_for_Traffic_Flow_Prediction.pdf:/media/aweissen/ef6d006c-11d1-45ba-ad13-50a91575ccd91/projects/papers/anita/2022/data/Temporal_Multi-Graph_Convolutional_Network_for_Traffic_Flow_Prediction.pdf:application/pdf,,,"1524-9050, 1558-0016",IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,,en,jun,,6.0,3337--3348,,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9098104/,2023-06-25,22.0,2021.0,Traffic volume prediction,Temporal Multi-Graph Convolutional Network,journal,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to solve such ﬂash crowd issues, we propose a novel system that can accurately predict the trafﬁc ﬂow and density in the urban area that can be used to avoid the V2X communication ﬂash crowd situation.

A key aspect of trajectory prediction is multimodal because of the uncertainty of vessel behavior. However, complex trajectory modes are difficult to be learned from low-dimensional AIS data with noise. In this paper, we propose a new method for multimodal vessel trajectory prediction, called Multimodal Vessel Trajectory Prediction via Modes Distribution Modeling (VT-MDM). This approach addresses the above challenges by introducing additional hiding regimes to characterize complex trajectory modes independently. Specifically, we introduce an additional latent vector as the encoding of the trajectory modes, which is randomly sampled from a multivariate Gaussian distribution to generate multiple predicted trajectories. To enable this Gaussian distribution for capturing the vessel trajectory modes, we use adversarial learning to enforce all its realizations to generate realistic predicted trajectories. Furthermore, we also encourage the mapping between the latent vectors of the modes and the predicted trajectories to be invertible and smooth, which prompts VT-MDM to produce truly and gradually multimodal predicted trajectories.

While previous work has made signiﬁcant efforts to learn trafﬁc temporal dynamics and spatial dependencies, two key limitations exist in current models. First, only the neighboring spatial correlations among adjacent regions are considered in most existing methods, and the global interregion dependency is ignored. Additionally, these methods fail to encode the complex trafﬁc transition regularities exhibited with time-dependent and multi-resolution in nature. To tackle these challenges, we develop a new trafﬁc prediction framework–Spatial-Temporal Graph Diffusion Network (ST-GDN).

cai_traffic_2020,article,"Cai, Ling and Janowicz, Krzysztof and Mai, Gengchen and Yan, Bo and Zhu, Rui",Traffic transformer: Capturing the continuity and periodicity of time series for traffic forecasting,"Traffic forecasting is a challenging problem due to the complexity of jointly modeling spatio-temporal dependencies at different scales. Recently, several hybrid deep learning models have been developed to capture such dependencies. These approaches typically utilize convolutional neural networks or graph neural networks (GNNs) to model spatial dependency and leverage recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn temporal dependency. However, RNNs are only able to capture sequential information in the time series, while being incapable of modeling their periodicity (e.g., weekly patterns). Moreover, RNNs are difficult to parallelize, making training and prediction less efficient. In this work we propose a novel deep learning architecture called Traffic Transformer to capture the continuity and periodicity of time series and to model spatial dependency. Our work takes inspiration from Google’s Transformer framework for machine translation. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world traffic data sets, and the results demonstrate that our model outperforms baseline models by a substantial margin.",,,,10.1111/tgis.12644,,Transactions in GIS - 2020 - Cai - Traffic transformer Capturing the continuity and periodicity of time series for traffic.pdf:/media/aweissen/ef6d006c-11d1-45ba-ad13-50a91575ccd91/projects/papers/anita/2022/data/Transactions in GIS - 2020 - Cai - Traffic transformer Capturing the continuity and periodicity of time series for traffic.pdf:application/pdf,,,"1361-1682, 1467-9671",Transactions in GIS,,en,jun,,3.0,736--755,,Traffic transformer,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tgis.12644,2023-06-25,24.0,2020.0,Traffic volume prediction,Transformer,article,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
choi_trajgail_2021,article,"Choi, Seongjin and Kim, Jiwon and Yeo, Hwasoo",TrajGAIL: Generating urban vehicle trajectories using generative adversarial imitation learning,"Recently, an abundant amount of urban vehicle trajectory data has been collected in road net­ works. Many studies have used machine learning algorithms to analyze patterns in vehicle tra­ jectories to predict location sequences of individual travelers. Unlike the previous studies that used a discriminative modeling approach, this research suggests a generative modeling approach to learn the underlying distributions of urban vehicle trajectory data. A generative model for urban vehicle trajectories can better generalize from training data by learning the underlying distribution of the training data and, thus, produce synthetic vehicle trajectories similar to real vehicle trajectories with limited observations. Synthetic trajectories can provide solutions to data sparsity or data privacy issues in using location data. This research proposes TrajGAIL, a gener­ ative adversarial imitation learning framework for the urban vehicle trajectory generation. In TrajGAIL, learning location sequences in observed trajectories is formulated as an imitation learning problem in a partially observable Markov decision process. The model is trained by the generative adversarial framework, which uses the reward function from the adversarial discriminator. The model is tested with both simulation and real-world datasets, and the results show that the proposed model obtained significant performance gains compared to existing models in sequence modeling.",,,,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103091,,1-s2.0-S0968090X21001121-main.pdf:/media/aweissen/ef6d006c-11d1-45ba-ad13-50a91575ccd91/projects/papers/anita/2022/data/1-s2.0-S0968090X21001121-main.pdf:application/pdf,,,0968090X,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,,en,jul,,,103091,,{TrajGAIL},,https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0968090X21001121,2023-06-25,128.0,2021.0,Synthetic data generation,GAN,journal,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
spadon_unfolding_2023,article,"Spadon, Gabriel and Ferreira, Martha D. and Soares, Amilcar and Matwin, Stan",Unfolding AIS Transmission Behavior for Vessel Movement Modeling on Noisy Data Leveraging Machine Learning,"The oceans are a source of an impressive mixture of complex data that could be used to uncover relationships yet to be discovered. Such data comes from the oceans and their surface, such as Automatic Identiﬁcation System (AIS) messages used for tracking vessels’ trajectories. AIS messages are transmitted over radio or satellite at ideally periodic time intervals but vary irregularly over time. As such, this paper aims to model the AIS message transmission behavior through neural networks for forecasting upcoming AIS messages’ content from multiple vessels, particularly in a simultaneous approach despite messages’ temporal irregularities as outliers. We present a set of experiments comprising multiple algorithms for forecasting tasks with horizon sizes of varying lengths. Deep learning models (e.g., neural networks) revealed themselves to adequately preserve vessels’ spatial awareness regardless of temporal irregularity. We show how convolutional layers, feed-forward networks, and recurrent neural networks can improve such tasks by working together. Experimenting with short, medium, and large-sized sequences of messages, our model achieved 36/37/38\% of the Relative Percentage Difference – the lower, the better, whereas we observed 92/45/96\% on the Elman’s RNN, 51/52/40\% on the GRU, and 129/98/61\% on the LSTM.

Moreover, in most current methods, trajectories are represented by geometric features or their low-dimensional linear combination, and some hidden features and high-dimensional combined features cannot be found efficiently. Meanwhile, traditional methods still cannot get rid of the limitation of space attributes. Therefore, a novel trajectory anomaly detection algorithm is present in this article. Unsupervised learning mechanism is used to overcome nonground-truth problem and deep representation method is used to represent trajectories in a comprehensive way. First, each trajectory is partitioned into segments according to its open angles, then the shallow features at each point of a segment are extracted and. In this way, each segment is represented as a feature sequence. Second, shallow features are integrated into autoencoder-based deep feature fusion model, and the fusion feature sequences can be extracted. Third, these fused feature sequences are grouped into different clusters using a unsupervised clustering algorithm, and then segments which quite differ from others are detected as anomalies.

zhang_urban_2022,article,"Zhang, Yingxue and Li, Yanhua and Zhou, Xun and Luo, Jun and Zhang, Zhi-Li",Urban Traffic Dynamics Prediction—A Continuous Spatial-temporal Meta-learning Approach,"Urban traffic status (e.g., traffic speed and volume) is highly dynamic in nature, namely, varying across space and evolving over time. Thus, predicting such traffic dynamics is of great importance to urban development and transportation management. However, it is very challenging to solve this problem due to spatial-temporal dependencies and traffic uncertainties. In this article, we solve the traffic dynamics prediction problem from Bayesian meta-learning perspective and propose a novel continuous spatial-temporal meta-learner (cST-ML), which is trained on a distribution of traffic prediction tasks segmented by historical traffic data with the goal of learning a strategy that can be quickly adapted to related but unseen traffic prediction tasks. cST-ML tackles the traffic dynamics prediction challenges by advancing the Bayesian black-box meta-learning framework through the following new points: (1) cST-ML captures the dynamics of traffic prediction tasks using variational inference, and to better capture the temporal uncertainties within tasks, cST-ML performs as a rolling window within each task; (2) cST-ML has novel designs in architecture, where CNN and LSTM are embedded to capture the spatial-temporal dependencies between traffic status and traffic-related features; (3) novel training and testing algorithms for cST-ML are designed. We also conduct experiments on two real-world traffic datasets (taxi inflow and traffic speed) to evaluate our proposed cST-ML. The experimental results verify that cST-ML can significantly improve the urban traffic prediction performance and outperform all baseline models especially when obvious traffic dynamics and temporal uncertainties are presented.",,,,10.1145/3474837,,3474837.pdf:/media/aweissen/ef6d006c-11d1-45ba-ad13-50a91575ccd91/projects/papers/anita/literatur_axel/3474837.pdf:application/pdf,,,"2157-6904, 2157-6912",ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology,,en,apr,,2.0,1--19,,,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3474837,2023-06-18,13.0,2022.0,Traffic volume prediction,CNN and LSTM,article,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

chen2020ship,article,"Chen, Xiang and Liu, Yuanchang and Achuthan, Kamalasudhan and Zhang, Xinyu",A ship movement classification based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data using Convolutional Neural Network,"With a wide use of AIS data in maritime transportation, there is an increasing demand to develop algorithms to efficiently classify a shipâ€™s AIS data into different movements (static, normal navigation and manoeuvring). To achieve this, several studies have been proposed to use labelled features but with the drawback of not being able to effectively extract the details of ship movement information. In addition, a ship movement is in a free space, which is different to a road vehicleâ€™s movement in road grids, making it inconvenient to directly migrate the methods for GPS data classification into AIS data. To deal with these problems, a Convolutional Neural Network-Ship Movement Modes Classification (CNN-SMMC) algorithm is proposed in this paper. The underlying concept of this method is to train a neural network to learn from the labelled AIS data, and the unlabelled AIS data can be effectively classified by using this trained network. More specifically, a Ship Movement Image Generation and Labelling (SMIGL) algorithm is first designed to convert a shipâ€™s AIS trajectories into different movement images to make a full use of the CNNâ€™s classification ability. Then, a CNN-SMMC architecture is built with a series of functional layers (convolutional layer, max-pooling layer, dense layer etc.) for ship movement classification with seven experiments been designed to find the optimal parameters for the CNN-SMMC. Considering the imbalanced features of AIS data, three metrics (average accuracy, 
 score and Area Under Curve (AUC)) are selected to evaluate the performance of the CNN-SMMC. Finally, several benchmark classification algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT)) are selected to compare with CNN-SMMC. The results demonstrate that the proposed CNN-SMMC has a better performance in the classification of AIS data.",,,,,,,,,,Ocean Engineering,,,,,,108182,Elsevier,,,,,218.0,2020.0,(Sub)trajectory classification,CNN,journal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, it is an ideal target for graph representation learning at scale. Here we present a graph neural network estimator for estimated time of arrival (ETA) which we have deployed in production at Google Maps.

In recent years, mobility digital twin that makes a virtual replication of human mobility and predicting or simulating the fine-grained movements of the subjects in a virtual space at a metropolitan scale in near real-time has shown its great potential in modern urban intelligent systems. However, few studies have provided practical solutions. The main difficulties are four-folds: 1) the daily variation of human mobility is hard to model and predict; 2) the transportation network enforces a complex constraints on human mobility; 3) generating a rational fine-grained human trajectory is challenging for existing machine learning models; and 4) making a fine-grained prediction incurs high computational costs, which is challenging for an online system. Bearing these difficulties in mind, in this paper we propose a two-stage human mobility predictor that stratifies the coarse and fine-grained level predictions. In the first stage, to encode the daily variation of human mobility at a metropolitan level, we automatically extract citywide mobility trends as crowd contexts and predict long-term and long-distance movements at a coarse level. In the second stage, the coarse predictions are resolved to a fine-grained level via a probabilistic trajectory retrieval method, which offloads most of the heavy computations to the offline phase. We tested our method using a real-world mobile phone GPS dataset in the Kanto area in Japan, and achieved good prediction accuracy and a time efficiency of about 2 min in predicting future 1h movements of about 220K mobile phone users on a single machine to support more higher-level analysis of mobility prediction.","New York, NY, USA",,Proceedings of the 30th International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,10.1145/3557915.3561040,,,,9781450395298.0,,,"traffic intelligence, mobility digital twin, human mobility prediction",,,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,,https://doi.org/10.1145/3557915.3561040,,,2022.0,Trajectory prediction/imputation,GRU,article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, predicting mobility is not trivial because of three challenges: 1) the complex sequential transition regularities exhibited with time-dependent and high-order nature; 2) the multi-level periodicity of human mobility; and 3) the heterogeneity and sparsity of the collected trajectory data. In this paper, we propose DeepMove, an attentional recurrent network for mobility prediction from lengthy and sparse trajectories. In DeepMove, we first design a multi-modal embedding recurrent neural network to capture the complicated sequential transitions by jointly embedding the multiple factors that govern the human mobility. Then, we propose a historical attention model with two mechanisms to capture the multi-level periodicity in a principle way, which effectively utilizes the periodicity nature to augment the recurrent neural network for mobility prediction.

Motivated by recent success of deep variational inference, we propose VANext (Variational Attention based Next) POI prediction: a latent variable model for inferring user's next footprint, with historical mobility attention. The variational encoding captures latent features of recent mobility, followed by searching the similar historical trajectories for periodical patterns. A trajectory convolutional network is then used to learn historical mobility, significantly improving the efficiency over often used recurrent networks. A novel variational attention mechanism is proposed to exploit the periodicity of historical mobility patterns, combined with recent check-in preference to predict next POIs. We also implement a semi-supervised variant - VANext-S, which relies on variational encoding for pre-training all current trajectories in an unsupervised manner, and uses the latent variables to initialize the current trajectory learning.

Existing traffic prediction approaches typically use raw traffic data and road networks without considering the physical environment and humanâ€“environment interaction. This article presents a novel traffic prediction model that considers: (1) the topological structure of the city road network; (2) the popularity and accessibility of each scenic spot in the city; and (3) the traffic volumes of nearby scenic spots. The proposed model first learns a series of traffic dependency graphs by the Multi-graph Convolutional Network using multiple data sources describing historical traffic volumes, scenic spots popularity, land function, location, and accessibility. The graph nodes represent the scenic spots, and the links between them represent their traffic dependency, considering all traffic and geographic features. Then the proposed model uses the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to capture the temporal dependency between multiple fused graphs for traffic volume prediction.

Improving next Location Prediction by Learning Travel Mode Information Using Transformers,"Predicting the next visited location of an individual is a key problem in human mobility analysis, as it is required for the personalization and optimization of sustainable transport options. Here, we propose a transformer decoder-based neural network to predict the next location an individual will visit based on historical locations, time, and travel modes, which are behaviour dimensions often overlooked in previous work. In particular, the prediction of the next travel mode is designed as an auxiliary task to help guide the network's learning. For evaluation, we apply this approach to two large-scale and long-term GPS tracking datasets involving more than 600 individuals. Our experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art next location prediction methods by a large margin (8.05% and 5.60% relative increase in F1-score for the two datasets, respectively). We conduct an extensive ablation study that quantifies the influence of considering temporal features, travel mode information, and the auxiliary task on the prediction results. Moreover, we experimentally determine the performance upper bound when including the next mode prediction in our model. Finally, our analysis indicates that the performance of location prediction varies significantly with the chosen next travel mode by the individual. These results show potential for a more systematic consideration of additional dimensions of travel behaviour in human mobility prediction tasks.

With the model developing from personal models with own information to the joint models with population information, the prediction performance of proposed models become better and better. Meanwhile, the privacy issues of these models come into the view of community and the public: collecting and uploading private data to the centralized server without enough regulation. In this paper, we propose PMF, a privacy-preserving mobility prediction framework via federated learning, to solve this problem without significantly sacrificing the prediction performance. In our framework, based on the deep learning mobility model, no private data is uploaded into the centralized server and the only uploaded thing is the updated model parameters which are difficult to crack and thus more secure. Furthermore, we design a group optimization method for the training on local devices to achieve better trade-off between performance and privacy. Finally, we propose a fine-tuned personal adaptor for personal modelling to further improve the prediction performance.

However, two limitations remain in the prediction of human activity intensity. First, it is hard to learn the spatial interaction patterns across scales for predicting human activities. Second, social interaction can help model the activity intensity variation but is rarely considered in the existing literature. To mitigate these limitations, we proposed a novel dynamic activity intensity prediction method with deep learning on graphs using the interactions in both physical and social spaces. In this method, the physical interactions and social interactions between spatial units were integrated into a fused graph convolutional network to model multi-type spatial interaction patterns. The future activity intensity variation was predicted by combining the spatial interaction pattern and the temporal pattern of activity intensity series. The method was verified with a country-scale anonymized mobile phone dataset. The results demonstrated that our proposed deep learning method with combining graph convolutional networks and recurrent neural networks outperformed other baseline approaches. This method enables dynamic human activity intensity prediction from a more spatially and socially integrated perspective, which helps improve the performance of modeling human dynamics.

However, it is relatively difficult to determine. With the rapid growth of urban mobility and big mobile data, utilizing these data for trip purpose classification has been a long-term objective to enhance travel demand and behavior models used in urban planning. Although studies on this topic have been extensively conducted, most past research preferred relying on traveler attributes or long-term travel histories to achieve accurate results. These data could be privacy sensitive and often do not satisfy real-world scenarios. This study addresses the problem of classifying trip purpose by only space activity information to avoid privacy conflict. 1) External memories are collected from factorized components based on the non-negative Tucker decomposition scheme. 2) These memories are extended by the cross-attention mechanism to achieve feature augmentation. 3) Subsequently, a novel concept called ""latent mode alignment"" is proposed. By leveraging the linear characteristics of external memories, geographic contextual latent modes are represented and matched with travel activities; this procedure is called ""alignment."" 4) The gate mechanism controls the eventual outputs for update. The proposed plug-in memory network (PMN), combined with baseline models, effectively outperforms the original settings. Moreover, combination models are validated with strong tolerance through missing data tests, which are common and problematic in real-world scenarios. The proposed PMN is a plug-and-play design that is easy to combine with newly developed classification models, and other memory collection methods can be expected.","New York, NY, USA",,Proceedings of the 30th International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,10.1145/3557915.3560969,,,,9781450395298.0,,,"trip purpose, memory network, matrix factorization, human mobility",,,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,,https://doi.org/10.1145/3557915.3560969,,,2022.0,Location classification,Memory Network,article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the key properties of crowd flow data is periodicity: a pattern that occurs at regular time intervals, such as a weekly pattern. To capture such periodicity, existing studies either fuse the periodic hidden states into channels for networks to learn or apply extra periodic strategies to the network architecture. In this paper, we devise a novel periodic residual learning network (PRNet) for a better modeling of periodicity in crowd flow data. Unlike existing methods, PRNet frames the crowd flow forecasting as a periodic residual learning problem by modeling the variation between the inputs (the previous time period) and the outputs (the future time period). Compared to directly predicting crowd flows that are highly dynamic, learning more stationary deviation is much easier, which thus facilitates the model training. Besides, the learned variation enables the network to produce the residual between future conditions and its corresponding weekly observations at each time interval, and therefore contributes to substantially more accurate multi-step ahead predictions. Extensive experiments show that PR-Net can be easily integrated into existing models to enhance their predictive performance.","New York, NY, USA",,Proceedings of the 30th International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,10.1145/3557915.3560947,,,,9781450395298.0,,,"deep learning, spatio-temporal data mining, crowd flow, periodic residual, convolutional neural networks, urban computing",,,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,,https://doi.org/10.1145/3557915.3560947,,,2022.0,Traffic volume prediction,CNN,article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Then, three kinds of modular network structures with different depths are trained and optimized to determine the appropriate convolutional neural network structure. In the validation phase of the model, a large amount of verified data with a time span of one month was used, covering a variety of water conditions including open water, ports, rivers and lakes. Following this approach, a kind of CNN scheme which can be directly used to identify ship types in a wide range of waters is proposed. This scheme can be used to judge the ship type when the static information is completely missing and to test the data when the ship type information is partially missing.",,,,,,,,,,Journal of Marine Science and Engineering,,,,,1.0,84,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,,,,,10.0,2022.0,(Sub)trajectory classification,CNN,journal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This problem is of great importance to urban development and transportation management, yet is very challenging because the plan would change the local travel demands drastically and the new travel demand pattern might be unprecedented in the historical data. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Conditional Urban Traffic Generative Adversarial Network (Curb-GAN), which provides traffic estimations in consecutive time slots based on different (unprecedented) travel demands, thus enables urban planners to accurately evaluate urban plans before deploying them. The proposed Curb-GAN adopts and advances the conditional GAN structure through a few novel ideas: (1) dealing with various travel demands as the ""conditions"" and generating corresponding traffic estimations, (2) integrating dynamic convolutional layers to capture the local spatial auto-correlations along the underlying road networks, (3) employing self-attention mechanism to capture the temporal dependencies of the traffic across different time slots. Extensive experiments on two real-world spatio-temporal datasets demonstrate that our Curb-GAN outperforms major baseline methods in estimation accuracy under various conditions and can produce more meaningful estimations.","New York, NY, USA",,Proceedings of the 26th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining,10.1145/3394486.3403127,,,,9781450379984.0,,,"traffic estimation, generative adversarial networks, self-attention, spatial-temporal data",,,,,842â€“852,Association for Computing Machinery,,,https://doi.org/10.1145/3394486.3403127,,,2020.0,Traffic volume prediction,"GAN, CNN",article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the flows in different areas and feature channels (inflow/outflow) may correspond to different degrees of importance in forecasting flows. Many forecasting models inadequately consider this heterogeneity, resulting in decreased predictive accuracy. To overcome this problem, an attention-based hybrid spatiotemporal residual model assisted by spatial and channel information is proposed in this study. By assigning different weights (attention levels) to different regions, the spatial attention module selects relatively important locations from all inputs in the modeling process. Similarly, the channel attention module selects relatively important channels from the multichannel feature map in the modeling process by assigning different weights. The proposed model provides effective selection and attention results for key areas and channels, respectively, during the forecasting process, thereby decreasing the computational overhead and increasing the accuracy. In the case involving Beijing, the proposed model exhibits a 3.7% lower prediction error, and its runtime is 60.9% less the model without attention, indicating that the spatial and channel attention modules are instrumental in increasing the forecasting efficiency.

These dynamic and static navigational factors impose limitations on vessels, such as long waiting times in regions outside the actual ports, and we call these waiting regions gateway ports. Identifying gateway ports and their associated features such as congestion and available utilities can enhance vessel navigation by planning on fuel optimization or saving time in cargo operation. In this paper, we propose a novel temporal graph neural network (TGNN) based port classification method to enable vessels to discover gateway ports efficiently, thus optimizing their operations. The proposed method processes vessel trajectory data to build dynamic graphs capturing spatio-temporal dependencies between a set of static and dynamic navigational features in the data, and it is evaluated in terms of port classification accuracy on a real-world data set collected from ten vessels operating in Halifax, NS, Canada.

In particular, when big rare events or disasters happen, such as large earthquakes or severe trafﬁc accidents, people change their behaviors from their routine activities.

In the literature, many approaches have been proposed to solve this classiﬁcation task including deep learning models like LSTM recently for sequence classiﬁcation. However, these approaches fail to consider both spatial and temporal interval information simultaneously, but share some common drawbacks: omitting either the spatial information or the temporal interval information out. Some models like Time-LSTM, have been proposed to handle the temporal interval information for spatio-temporal trajectories, but they do not take into account the spatial information. Note that, considering both spatial and temporal interval information is crucial for spatio-temporal data mining in order not to miss any spatio-temporal pattern. In this study, we propose a trajectory classiﬁer called Spatio-Temporal GRU to better model the spatio-temporal correlations and irregular temporal intervals prevalently present in spatio-temporal trajectories. We introduce a novel segmented convolutional weight mechanism to capture short-term local spatial correlations in trajectories and propose an additional temporal gate to control the information ﬂow related to the temporal interval information.

Nevertheless, various challenges, especially the quality of such a mobile task ofﬂoading in edge computing environment, are yet to be properly tackled. Most studies and related ofﬂoading strategies based on the assumption that mobile users are fully stationary when they are ofﬂoading tasks to edge servers. However, this is not realistic in real-world where edge users are keeping moving, which has a great impact on the success of task ofﬂoading and further affects the response time of mobile applications. In this paper, we take the mobility of edge users into consideration and employ a deep learning method to predict the future trajectories of mobile users. Then we develop an online method to solve the ofﬂoading problem based on the quality-of-service (QoS) and the predicted user trajectories in real-time.

Motivated by recent success of deep variational inference, we propose VANext (Variational Attention based Next) POI prediction: a latent variable model for inferring user’s next footprint, with historical mobility attention. The variational encoding captures latent features of recent mobility, followed by searching the similar historical trajectories for periodical patterns. A trajectory convolutional network is then used to learn historical mobility, significantly improving the efficiency over often used recurrent networks. A novel variational attention mechanism is proposed to exploit the periodicity of historical mobility patterns, combined with recent check-in preference to predict next POIs.

Since the data of the individual-level mobility requires privacy protection, it’s hard to collect detailed population flow data. There have been published works on generating population flow from aggregated data. But they have the limitations of considering the flow between neighbors only or modeling the mapping from aggregated population data to flow by a simple physical model without taking regionally diversity into account. However, long-range dependencies and regionally diversity is very important. Since population flow contains more information than that in aggregated population variation, generating the detailed former from the aggregated latter is quite difficult. In this paper, we proposed an end-to-end structure deep learning based model to generate population flow from aggregated historical population variation data.

The study of trajectory mining that converts knowledge into decision support becomes appealing. Mobility modes awareness is one of the most important aspects of trajectory mining. It contributes to land use planning, intelligent transportation, anomaly events prevention, etc. To achieve better comprehension of mobility modes, we propose a method to integrate the issues of mobility modes discovery and mobility modes identiﬁcation together. Firstly, route patterns of trajectories were mined based on unsupervised origin and destination (OD) points clustering. After the combination of route patterns and travel activity information, diﬀerent mobility modes existing in history trajectories were discovered. Then a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method was proposed to identify the mobility modes of newly emerging trajectories. The labeled history trajectory data were utilized to train the identiﬁcation model. Moreover, in this approach, we introduced a mobility-based trajectory structure as the input of the identiﬁcation model. This method was evaluated with a real-world maritime trajectory dataset.

dabiri_deep_2020,article,"Dabiri, Sina and Marković, Nikola and Heaslip, Kevin and Reddy, Chandan K.",A deep convolutional neural network based approach for vehicle classification using large-scale GPS trajectory data,"Transportation agencies are starting to leverage increasingly-available GPS trajectory data to support their analyses and decision making. While this type of mobility data adds significant value to various analyses, one challenge that persists is lack of information about the types of vehicles that performed the recorded trips, which clearly limits the value of trajectory data in transportation system analysis. To overcome this limitation of trajectory data, a deep Convolutional Neural Network for Vehicle Classification (CNN-VC) is proposed to identify the vehicle’s class from its trajectory. This paper proposes a novel representation of GPS trajectories, which is not only compatible with deep learning models, but also captures both vehicle-motion characteristics and roadway features. To this end, an open source navigation system is also exploited to obtain more accurate information on travel time and distance between GPS coordinates. Before delving into training the CNN-VC model, an efficient programmatic strategy is also designed to label large-scale GPS trajectories by means of vehicle information obtained through Virtual Weigh Station records. Our experimental results reveal that the proposed CNNVC model consistently outperforms both classical machine learning algorithms and other deep learning baseline methods. From a practical perspective, the CNN-VC model allows us to label raw GPS trajectories with vehicle classes, thereby enriching the data and enabling more comprehensive transportation studies such as derivation of vehicle class-specific origin-destination tables that can be used for planning.",,,,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102644,,Dabiri et al. - 2020 - A deep convolutional neural network based approach.pdf:files/375/Dabiri et al. - 2020 - A deep convolutional neural network based approach.pdf:application/pdf,,,0968090X,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,,en,jul,,,102644,,,,https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0968090X20305593,2023-07-04,116,2020.0,(Sub)trajectory classification,GNN,journal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to privacy concerns, legal issues, and expensive measurement costs for real user mobility traces, synthetic mobility traces are widely used for research and development purposes. Until now, most of the user mobility synthesis approaches have been categorized into two major paradigms: stochastic modeling and simulation. However, they naturally have a limitation in mimicking actual user movements because it is impossible to capture all temporal, spatial, and behavioral characteristics that are implicitly melted in real user mobility. Along with the recent advancements of deep learning technologies, there have been several challenging proposals that exploit the power of the deep learning, especially generative models, in mobility synthesis.

It is a challenging problem as it is inﬂuenced by multiple factors, such as spatio-temporal dependencies with external factors (as events and weather conditions). In recent years, with the exponential data growth and technological advancement, deep learning has been adopted to approach urban mobility problems by addressing spatial dependency with convolutional neural networks and the temporal one with recurrent neural networks. We propose a spatio-temporal ﬂow prediction framework, called 3D-CLoST, that exploits the synergy between 3D convolution and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to jointly learn the characteristics of the space-time correlation from low to high levels.

In the context of human mobility analysis, the problem of motion prediction assumes a central role and is beneﬁcial for a wide range of applications, including for touristic purposes, such as personalized services or targeted recommendations, and sustainability studies related to crowd management and resource redistribution. This paper tackles a particular case of the trajectory prediction problem, focusing on large-scale mobility traces of short-term foreign tourists. These sparse trajectories, short and non-repetitive, lack spatial and temporal regularity, making prediction analysis based on individual historical motion data unreliable. To face this issue, we hereby propose a deep learning-based approach, taking into account the collective mobility of tourists over the territory. The underlying semantics of motion patterns are captured by means of a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network model trained on pre-processed location sequences, aiming to predict the next visited place in the trajectory.

This study aims to assess the feasibility of transferring the neural machine translation approach into a completely diﬀerent context, namely human mobility and trajectory analysis. Building a conceptual parallelism between sentences (sequences of words) and motion traces (sequences of locations), we aspire to translate individual trajectories generated by a certain category of users into the corresponding mobility traces potentially generated by a diﬀerent category of users.

The model adopted is based on the seq2seq approach and consists of an encoder–decoder architecture based on long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks and neural embeddings. The encoder turns an input location sequence into a corresponding hidden vector; the decoder reverses the process, turning the vector into an output location sequence.

UAVassisted vehicular networking research typically adopts throughput and latency as the main performance metrics. These conventional metrics, however, are not adequate to reﬂect the freshness of the information, an attribute that has been recently identiﬁed as a critical requirement to enable services such as autonomous driving and accident prevention. In this paper, we consider a UAV-assisted single-hop vehicular network, wherein sensors (e.g., LiDARs and cameras) on vehicles generate time sensitive data streams, and UAVs are used to collect and process this data while maintaining a minimum age of information (AoI). We aim to jointly optimize the trajectories of UAVs and ﬁnd scheduling policies to keep the information fresh under minimum throughput constraints. The formulated optimization problem is shown to be mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP) and generally hard to be solved. Motivated by the success of machine learning (ML) techniques particularly deep learning in solving complex problems with low complexity, we reformulate the trajectories and scheduling policies problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) where the system state space considers the vehicular network dynamics. Then, we develop deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to learn the vehicular environment and its dynamics in order to handle UAVs’ trajectory and scheduling policy. In particular, we leverage Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) for learning the trajectories of the deployed UAVs to efﬁciently minimize the Expected Weighted Sum AoI (EWSA). Simulations results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design and show the deployed UAVs adapt their velocities during the data collection mission in order to minimize the AoI.",,,,10.1109/TVT.2020.3023861,,Samir et al. - 2020 - Age of Information Aware Trajectory Planning of UA.pdf:files/430/Samir et al. - 2020 - Age of Information Aware Trajectory Planning of UA.pdf:application/pdf,,,"0018-9545, 1939-9359",IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,,en,nov,,11.0,12382--12395,,Age of {Information} {Aware} {Trajectory} {Planning} of {UAVs} in {Intelligent} {Transportation} {Systems},,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9195789/,2023-07-04,69,2020.0,Estimated Time of Arrival,Deep Reinforcement learning and MDP,journal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In practice, Hidden Markov Model and its variants are widely used to provide accurate and efﬁcient map matching service. However, HMM-based methods fail to utilize the knowledge (e.g., the mobility pattern) of enormous trajectory big data, which are useful for intelligent map matching. Furthermore, with many following-up works, they are still easily inﬂuenced by the common noisy and sparse records in the reality. In this paper, we revisit the map matching task from the data perspective and propose to utilize the great power of massive data and deep learning to solve these problems. Based on the seq2seq learning framework, we build a trajectory2road model with attention mechanism to map the sparse and noisy trajectory into the accurate road network. Different from previous algorithms, our deep learning based model complete the map matching in the latent space, which provides the high tolerance to the noisy trajectory and also enhances the matching with the knowledge of mobility pattern.

This problem is important in many real-world applications such as driver verification in ride-sharing services, risk analysis for auto insurance companies, and criminal identification. Prior work on identifying human mobility behaviors requires additional data from other sources besides the trajectories, e.g., sensor readings in the vehicle for driving behavior identification. However, these data might not be universally available and is costly to obtain. To deal with this challenge, in this work, we make the first attempt to match identities of human agents only from the observed location trajectory data by proposing a novel and efficient framework named Spatio-temporal Siamese Networks (ST-SiameseNet). For each human agent, we extract a set of profile and online features from his/her trajectories. We train ST-SiameseNet to predict the mobility signature similarity between each pair of agents, where each agent is represented by his/her trajectories and the extracted features.

A. and Campos, Carlos Alberto V. and Obraczka, Katia",A Deep Learning Approach for Identifying User Communities Based on Geographical Preferences and Its Applications to Urban and Environmental Planning,"Understanding human mobility plays a vital role in urban and environmental planning as cities continue to grow. Ubiquitous geo-location, localization technology, and availability of big-data-ready computing infrastructure have enabled the development of more sophisticated models to characterize human mobility in urban areas. In this work, our main goal is to extract spatio-temporal features that characterize user mobility and, based on the similarity of these features, identify user
              communities
              . To this end, we propose a novel approach that leverages image processing techniques to represent user geographical preferences as images and then apply deep convolutional autoencoders to extract latent spatio-temporal mobility features from these images. These features are then fed to a clustering algorithm that identifies the underlying community structures. We use a diverse urban mobility dataset to validate the proposed framework. Our results show that the proposed framework is able to significantly increase the similarity between intra-community nodes (by up to 107\%) as well as dissimilarity between inter-community nodes (up to 54\%) when compared against no pre-processing of the datasets, i.e without pre-processing the datasets through any feature fusion method. Moreover, it was also able to reach up to 100\% improvement when compared against community identification using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Our results also show that the proposed approach yields significant increase in contact time amongst users belonging to the same community, by up to 80\% when compared to the average contact time when not considering community structures, and by up to 150\% when compared to the baseline. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal is the first to consider deep convolutional autoencoding to perform automatic extraction of non-linear spatio-temporal mobility features characterizing individual users from raw mobility datasets with the goal of identifying user communities.",,,,10.1145/3380970,,Ferreira et al. - 2020 - A Deep Learning Approach for Identifying User Comm.pdf:files/414/Ferreira et al. - 2020 - A Deep Learning Approach for Identifying User Comm.pdf:application/pdf,,,"2374-0353, 2374-0361",ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems,,en,sep,,3.0,1--24,,,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3380970,2023-07-04,6,2020.0,(Sub)trajectory classification,CNN-Autoencoder,journal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The latter can be inferred from users’ GPS records, as captured by smartphone or vehicle sensors. The recently demonstrated prevalence of deep neural networks in learning from data makes them a promising candidate for transportation mode identiﬁcation. However, the massive geospatial data produced by GPS sensors are typically unlabeled. To address this problem, we propose an unsupervised learning approach for transportation mode identiﬁcation. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst pretrain a deep Convolutional AutoEncoder (CAE) using unlabeled ﬁxed-size trajectory segments. Then, we attach a clustering layer to the CAE’s embedding layer, the former maintaining cluster centroids as trainable weights. Finally, we retrain the composite clustering model, encouraging the encoder’s learned representation of the input data to be clustering-friendly by striking a balance between the model’s reconstruction and clustering losses. By further incorporating features computed over each segment, we achieve a clustering accuracy of 80.5\% on the Geolife dataset without using any labels.

yu_travel_2021,article,"Yu, James J. Q.",Travel Mode Identification With GPS Trajectories Using Wavelet Transform and Deep Learning,"Accurate identiﬁcation in public travel modes is an essential task in intelligent transportation systems. In recent years, GPS-based identiﬁcation is gradually replacing the conventional survey-based information-gathering process due to the more detailed and precise data on individual’s travel patterns. Nonetheless, existing research suffers from deﬁcient feature selection, high data dimensionality, and data under-utilization issues. In this work, we propose a novel travel mode identiﬁcation mechanism based on discrete wavelet transform and recent developments of deep learning techniques. The proposed mechanism aims to take GPS trajectories of arbitrary lengths to develop accurate travel mode results in both global and online identiﬁcation scenarios. In this mechanism, raw GPS data is ﬁrst pre-processed to compute preliminary motion and displacement attributes, which are input into a tailor-made deep neural network. Discrete wavelet transform is also adopted to further extract time-frequency domain characteristics of the trajectories to assist the neural network in the classiﬁcation task. To evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism, a series of comprehensive case studies are conducted. The results indicate that the mechanism can notably outperform existing travel mode identiﬁcations on a same data set with minuscule computation time. Furthermore, an architecture test is performed to determine the best-performing structure for the proposed mechanism. Lastly, we demonstrate the capability of the mechanism in handling online identiﬁcations, and the performance sensitivity of the selected attributes is evaluated.",,,,10.1109/TITS.2019.2962741,,Yu - 2021 - Travel Mode Identification With GPS Trajectories U.pdf:files/367/Yu - 2021 - Travel Mode Identification With GPS Trajectories U.pdf:application/pdf,,,"1524-9050, 1558-0016",IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,,en,feb,,2.0,1093--1103,,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8947978/,2023-07-04,22,2021.0,(Sub)trajectory classification,LSTM,journal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
xu_predicting_2021,article,"Xu, Jiajie and Zhao, Jing and Zhou, Rui and Liu, Chengfei and Zhao, Pengpeng and Zhao, Lei",Predicting Destinations by a Deep Learning based Approach,"Destination prediction is known as an important problem for many location based services (LBSs). Existing solutions generally apply probabilistic models or neural network models to predict destinations over a subtrajectory, and adopt the standard attention mechanism to improve the prediction accuracy. However, the standard attention mechanism uses ﬁxed feature representations, and has a limited ability to represent distinct features of locations. Besides, existing methods rarely take the impact of spatial and temporal characteristics of the trajectory into account. Their accuracies in ﬁne-granularity prediction are always not satisfactory due to the data sparsity problem. Thus, in this paper, a carefully designed deep learning model called LATL model is presented. It not only adopts an adaptive attention network to model the distinct features of locations, but also implements time gates and distance gates into the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture the spatial-temporal relation between consecutive locations. Furthermore, to better understand the mobility patterns in different spatial granularities, and explore the fusion of multi-granularity learning capability, a hierarchical model that utilizes tailored combination of different neural networks under multiple spatial granularities is further proposed.

However, it is still not clear how driving behaviors and energy consumption correlate with each other and to what extent these factors related to connected vehicles can inﬂuence the motion prediction performance. The precise recognition of driving behaviors and prediction of the vehicle motion is critical to the driving safety for connected automated vehicles (CAVs). Hence, in this study, an energy-aware driving pattern analysis and motion prediction system are proposed for CAVs using a deep learning-based time-series modeling approach. First, energy-aware longitudinal acceleration and deceleration behaviors and lateral lane-change behaviors are statistically analyzed. Then, a sliding standard deviation (SSD) test is applied to evaluate the smoothness of the trajectory and velocity signals considering different energy consumption levels. An energy-aware personalized joint time-series modeling (PJTSM) approach based on a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) cell are proposed for accurate motion (trajectory and velocity) prediction of the leading vehicle. Finally, the differences in the prediction performance regarding different energy consumption levels are compared and discussed. It is shown that due to the higher randomness of the driving behaviors, the prediction accuracy for heavy energy users is the lowest among the three categories, which means it is harder to anticipate the driving behaviors of cars exhibiting heavy energy consumption. The personalized estimation of driving behaviors of CAVs will contribute to safer automated driving and transportation systems.",,,,10.1109/TITS.2021.3052786,,Xing et al. - 2021 - Toward Safe and Smart Mobility Energy-Aware Deep .pdf:files/365/Xing et al. - 2021 - Toward Safe and Smart Mobility Energy-Aware Deep .pdf:application/pdf,,,"1524-9050, 1558-0016",IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,,en,jul,,7.0,4267--4280,,Toward {Safe} and {Smart} {Mobility},,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9339947/,2023-07-04,22,2021.0,(Sub)trajectory classification,LSTM,journal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such services are usually deployed at the multi-access edge computing (MEC) to ensure low-latency communication and thus guarantee real-time reactions to avoid collisions between vehicles. In order to maximize the coverage of the road and ensure that all vehicles are connected to an optimal MEC host (in terms of geographical location), the collision avoidance application needs to be instantiated on all the MEC hosts. This may add a burden on the computing resources available at the latter. In this article, we propose an AI-empowered framework that aims to optimize the computing resources at the MEC hosts. Our framework uses deep learning to predict the vehicle density to be served by a MEC host and derive the exact computing resources required by the collision detection application to run optimally.

However, it inevitably raises an issue that may be aggravated by TUL, i.e., how to defend against location attacks (e.g., deanonymization and location recovery). In this work, we present a Semisupervised Trajectory- User Linking model with Interpretable representation and Gaussian mixture prior (STULIG)—a novel deep probabilistic framework for jointly learning disentangled representation of user trajectories in a semisupervised manner and tackling the location recovery problem. STULIG characterizes multiple latent aspects of human trajectories and their labels into separate latent variables, which can be then used to interpret user check-in styles and improve the performance of trace classiﬁcation. It can also generate synthetic yet plausible trajectories, thus protecting users’ actual locations while preserving the meaningful mobility information for various machine learning tasks. We analyze and evaluate STULIG’s ability to learn disentangled representations, discriminating human traces and generating realistic motions on several real-world mobility data sets. As demonstrated by extensive experimental evaluations, in addition to outperforming the stateof-the-art methods, our method provides intuitive explanations of the classiﬁcation and generation and sheds lights on the interpretable mobility mining.",,,,10.1109/TNNLS.2020.3005325,,Zhou et al. - 2021 - Toward Discriminating and Synthesizing Motion Trac.pdf:files/363/Zhou et al. - 2021 - Toward Discriminating and Synthesizing Motion Trac.pdf:application/pdf,,,"2162-237X, 2162-2388",IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems,,en,jun,,6.0,2401--2414,,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9165954/,2023-07-04,32,2021.0,Location classification,Autoencoder,journal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using Bluetooth vehicle trajectory data from Brisbane, Australia, we compare the prediction performance of the proposed models with several existing approaches including hidden Markov model and other LSTM-based models. The results show that the pro­ posed models produce higher prediction accuracy for both location and time prediction tasks, with the sequential LSTM yielding the best performance. Compared to the conventional next location prediction problem, which considers location sequences only without travel time consideration, the study finds that jointly modelling location and travel time sequences actually improves the next location prediction performance itself, potentially because travel time obser­ vations capture the information on traffic conditions in the network, which may affect drivers’ location choices. We demonstrate an application of the proposed models in network traffic management, where important locations can be identified to mitigate congestion in a hot-spot by predicting where vehicles come from and go next in an urban road network.",,,,10.1016/j.trc.2021.103114,,Sun und Kim - 2021 - Joint prediction of next location and travel time .pdf:files/377/Sun und Kim - 2021 - Joint prediction of next location and travel time .pdf:application/pdf,,,0968090X,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,,en,jul,,,103114,,,,https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0968090X21001339,2023-07-04,128,2021.0,Next location / final destination prediction,LSTM,journal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Shamim",Mobility-Aware Proactive Edge Caching for Connected Vehicles Using Federated Learning,"Content Caching at the edge of vehicular networks has been considered as a promising technology to satisfy the increasing demands of computation-intensive and latency-sensitive vehicular applications for intelligent transportation. The existing content caching schemes, when used in vehicular networks, face two distinct challenges: 1) Vehicles connected to an edge server keep moving, making the content popularity varying and hard to predict. 2) Cached content is easily out-ofdate since each connected vehicle stays in the area of an edge server for a short duration. To address these challenges, we propose a Mobility-aware Proactive edge Caching scheme based on Federated learning (MPCF). This new scheme enables multiple vehicles to collaboratively learn a global model for predicting content popularity with the private training data distributed on local vehicles. MPCF also employs a Context-aware Adversarial AutoEncoder to predict the highly dynamic content popularity. Besides, MPCF integrates a mobility-aware cache replacement policy, which allows the network edges to add/evict contents in response to the mobility patterns and preferences of vehicles. MPCF can greatly improve cache performance, effectively protect users’ privacy and signiﬁcantly reduce communication costs. Experimental results demonstrate that MPCF outperforms other baseline caching schemes in terms of the cache hit ratio in vehicular edge networks.",,,,10.1109/TITS.2020.3017474,,Yu et al. - 2021 - Mobility-Aware Proactive Edge Caching for Connecte.pdf:files/462/Yu et al. - 2021 - Mobility-Aware Proactive Edge Caching for Connecte.pdf:application/pdf,,,"1524-9050, 1558-0016",IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,,en,aug,,8.0,5341--5351,,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9181482/,2023-07-04,22,2021.0,Traffic volume prediction,LSTM,journal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the high mobility of vehicles brings difﬁculties to provide reliable services in the MEC system due to potential outages of communication in the process of ofﬂoading. Also, load balancing of the MEC system is seldom considered in previous ofﬂoading schemes, which may increase the risk of system failure and reduce Quality of Service (QoS) of vehicles due to congestions. Currently, we still lack a low-complexity method to address these issues. In this paper, we aim to promote QoS of vehicular applications by taking vehicles’ mobility and latency requirements into account while guaranteeing load balancing of the MEC system. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst formulate the joint ofﬂoading decision and resource allocation problem as a Mixed Integer NonLinear Programming (MINLP) problem. Then, by taking advantage of both Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), we propose a novel framework to effectively address the problem, where PSO accelerates the training by providing high quality labeled data to DNN. Finally, simulation results show that our proposed method outperforms traditional heuristic algorithms in terms of QoS and runtime.","Helsinki, Finland",,2021 {IEEE} 93rd {Vehicular} {Technology} {Conference} ({VTC2021}-{Spring}),10.1109/VTC2021-Spring51267.2021.9448705,,Hsu et al. - 2021 - Mobility-Aware QoS Promotion and Load Balancing in.pdf:files/463/Hsu et al. - 2021 - Mobility-Aware QoS Promotion and Load Balancing in.pdf:application/pdf,,978-1-72818-964-2,,,,en,apr,,,1--6,IEEE,Mobility-{Aware} {QoS} {Promotion} and {Load} {Balancing} in {MEC}-{Based} {Vehicular} {Networks},,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9448705/,2023-07-04,,2021.0,(Sub)trajectory classification,autoencoder,article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, with the existing methodologies, it is still difficult to accurately predict millions of peoples’ mobility in a large urban area such as Tokyo, Shanghai, and Hong Kong, especially when collected data used for model training are often limited to a small portion of the total population. Obviously, human activities in city are closely linked with point-of-interest (POI) information, which can reflect the semantic meaning of human mobility. This motivates us to fuse human mobility data and city POI data to improve the prediction performance with limited training data, but current fusion technologies can hardly handle these two heterogeneous data. Therefore, we propose a unique POI-embedding mechanism, that aggregates the regional POIs by categories to generate an artificial POI-image for each urban grid and enriches each trajectory snippet to a four-dimensional tensor in an analogous manner to a short video. Then, we design a deep learning architecture combining CNN with LSTM to simultaneously capture both the spatiotemporal and geographical information from the enriched trajectories. Furthermore, transfer learning is employed to transfer mobility knowledge from one city to another, so that we can fully utilize other cities’ data to train a stronger model for the target city with only limited data available. Finally, we achieve satisfactory performance of human mobility prediction at the citywide level using a limited amount of trajectories as training data, which has been validated over five urban areas of different types and scales.",,,,10.1145/3416914,,Jiang et al. - 2021 - Transfer Urban Human Mobility via POI Embedding ov.pdf:files/417/Jiang et al. - 2021 - Transfer Urban Human Mobility via POI Embedding ov.pdf:application/pdf,,,2691-1922,ACM/IMS Transactions on Data Science,,en,feb,,1.0,1--26,,,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3416914,2023-07-04,2,2021.0,Trajectory prediction/imputation,CRNN,journal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mobility trajectory prediction refers to the model-based projection of an individual’s location in the foreseeable future, within the boundaries of a predefined area. This information is proved to be an important input for information systems in multiple ICT-related scientific fields. Various algorithms have been proposed so far for solving this problem, however, traditional predictive approaches are shown to underperform in accuracy and reliability. This leaves room for more sophisticated, deep-learning modeling formulations. Framed within this statement, the focus in this paper is placed on contemporary deep learning approaches for trajectory prediction and more specifically, sequential machine learning models such as the Social GAN, Trajectory Transformer, and the proposed scheme, which is based on a customized GRU neural network extended with the attention mechanism. The three approaches are theoretically described and most importantly, they are implemented, validated, and evaluated on top of a realistic experimental platform and based on both simulated mobility data and open-source mobility datasets. The evaluation process of the models takes into consideration ml regression error metrics, qualitative 2D projection but also system aspects such as training complexity in the form of hyperparameter order.

A thorough analysis of mobility patterns in urban areas can provide various benefits, such as the prediction of traffic flow and public transportation usage. In particular, based on its exceptional ability to extract patterns from complex large-scale data, embedding based on deep learning is a promising method for analyzing the mobility patterns of urban residents. However, as urban mobility becomes increasingly complex, it becomes difficult to embed patterns into a single vector because of its limited capacity. In this paper, we propose a novel method for analyzing urban mobility based on deep learning. The proposed method involves clustering mobility patterns and embedding them to capture their implicit meaning. Clustering groups mobility patterns based on their spatiotemporal characteristics, and embedding provides meaningful information regarding both individual residents (i.e., personalized mobility) and all residents as a whole, enabling a more effective analysis of mobility patterns. Experiments were performed to predict the successive points of interest (POIs) based on transportation data collected from 1.5 million citizens in a large metropolitan city; the results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves top-1, 3, and 5 accuracies of 73.64\%, 88.65\%, and 91.54\%, respectively, which are much higher than those of the conventional method (59.48\%, 75.85\%, and 80.1\%, respectively).

Q. and Xu, Richard Yi Da",Capturing Uncertainty in Unsupervised GPS Trajectory Segmentation Using Bayesian Deep Learning,"Intelligent transportation management requires not only statistical information on users’ mobility patterns, but also knowledge of their corresponding transportation modes. While GPS trajectories can be readily obtained from GPS sensors found in modern smartphones and vehicles, these massive geospatial data are neither automatically annotated nor segmented by transportation mode, subsequently complicating transportation mode identiﬁcation. In addition, predictive uncertainty caused by the learned model parameters or variable noise in GPS sensor readings typically remains unaccounted for. To jointly address the above issues, we propose a Bayesian deep learning framework for unsupervised GPS trajectory segmentation. After unlabeled GPS trajectories are preprocessed into sequences of motion features, they are used in unsupervised training of a channel-calibrated temporal convolutional neural network for timestep-level transportation mode identiﬁcation. At test time, we approximate variational inference via Monte Carlo dropout sampling, leveraging the mean and variance of the predicted distributions to classify each input timestep and estimate its predictive uncertainty, respectively.

Drones have emerged as critical assets for next-generation wireless networks to provide seamless connectivity and extend the coverage, and can largely beneﬁt from operating in the THz band to achieve high data rates (such as considered for 6G). However, THz communications are highly susceptible to channel impairments and blockage effects that become extra challenging when accounting for drone mobility. RISs offer ﬂexibility to extend coverage by adapting to channel dynamics. To integrate RISs into THz drone communications, we propose a novel deep learning solution based on a recurrent neural network, namely the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), that proactively predicts the serving base station/RIS and the serving beam for each drone based on the prior observations of drone location/beam trajectories. This solution has the potential to extend the coverage of drones and enhance the reliability of next-generation wireless communications. Predicting future beams based on the drone beam/position trajectory signiﬁcantly reduces the beam training overhead and its associated latency, and thus emerges as a viable solution to serve time-critical applications.

The concern is that the data may contain much inaccuracy about the actual traffic situations, because taxi drivers often choose optimal routes to evade from the congestions caused by traffic anomalies. We use bus trajectory data in this work. Bus trajectories can capture real traffic conditions in the road networks without drivers’ preference, which are more objective and appropriate for accurately detecting anomalous patterns for a broad range of insight analyses on traffics. We proposed a deep learning-based feature visualization method to map 3-dimensional features into a red–green–blue (RGB) color space. A color trajectory (CT) is then derived by encoding a trajectory with the RGB colors. With the spatial and temporal properties extracted from the CT, spatio-temporal outliers are detected by a novel offline detection method. We then conduct GIS map fusion to obtain insights for better understanding the traffic anomaly locations, and more importantly the influences on the road affected by the corresponding anomalies.

However, human mobility data is usually sporadically updated since people may not frequently access mobile apps or publish the geotagged contents. Consequently, distilling meaningful supervised signals from sparse and noisy human mobility is the main challenge of existing models.

It provides a principled way to characterize the inherent movement correlations while tackling the implicit feedback and weak supervision problems in existing model-based approaches.

The proposed approach employs an ensemble of deep neural networks to infer the time-dependent reproduction number of an infectious disease by formulating a tensor-based multi-step loss function that allows us to efficiently calibrate the model on multiple observed trajectories. The method is applied to a mobility and social behavior-based SEIR model of COVID-19 spread. The model is trained on Google and Unacast mobility data spanning a period of 66 days, and is able to yield accurate future forecasts of COVID-19 spread in 203 US counties within a time-window of 15 days. Interestingly, a sensitivity analysis that assesses the importance of different mobility and social behavior parameters reveals that attendance of close places, including workplaces, residential, and retail and recreational locations, has the largest impact on the effective reproduction number. The model enables us to rapidly probe and quantify the effects of government interventions, such as lock-down and re-opening strategies. Taken together, the proposed framework provides a robust workflow for data-driven epidemiology model discovery under uncertainty and produces probabilistic forecasts for the evolution of a pandemic that can judiciously provide information for policy and decision making.

In addition, there are delay-sensitive applications that require establishing communication paths as soon as possible to mitigate low network performance in terms of end-to-end delay, reducing, at the same time, the energy consumption of the network. For this reason, we propose a multiobjective mathematical optimization model for ﬁnding the optimal communication path between a source node and a sink (base station) considering hard scenarios where all network nodes are mobile and minimizing end-to-end delay and energy consumption. This mathematical model would offer signiﬁcant advantages to evaluate new algorithms due to we could know how far or close are the algorithm results from the optimal values given by the mathematical model. In addition, we propose a prediction distributed routing algorithm based on Markov Chains that takes into account the network mobility in order to ﬁnd as fast as possible a communication path between a source node and a sink with minimal energy consumption. We also propose a deep learning approach to predict future nodes’ distances in a mobile network to determine if future movements of nodes will cause communication disruptions in paths. Signiﬁcant ﬁndings were obtained when the Markov Chains and Deep Learning approaches were compared in terms of predicting nodes mobility and reducing the delay and the energy consumption in the network. The performance of our prediction algorithms (Markov Chains and Deep Learning approaches) is evaluated against the mathematical model to determine how good it is. Finally, to analyze our prediction algorithms considering real online scenarios, we compared it against typical routing algorithms, obtaining promising results in terms of delay and energy consumption in all mobile node scenarios.",,,,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3124737,,Montoya et al. - 2021 - Energy-Efficient and Delay Sensitive Routing Paths.pdf:files/445/Montoya et al. - 2021 - Energy-Efficient and Delay Sensitive Routing Paths.pdf:application/pdf,,,2169-3536,IEEE Access,,en,,,,153382--153400,,Energy-{Efficient} and {Delay} {Sensitive} {Routing} {Paths} {Using} {Mobility} {Prediction} in {Mobile} {WSN},,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9598816/,2023-07-04,9,2021.0,Estimated Time of Arrival,deep MLP,journal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DeepeST is the ﬁrst deep learning model for trajectory classiﬁcation that provides approaches for coping with imbalanced dataset problems from the authors’ knowledge. In this paper, we perform the experiments with three real datasets from LBSN (Location-Based Social Network) trajectories to identify who is the user of a sub-trajectory (similar to the Trajectory-User Linking problem).

gentili_characterization_2021,article,"Gentili, Alessia and Volpe, Giorgio",Characterization of anomalous diffusion classical statistics powered by deep learning (CONDOR),"Diffusion processes are important in several physical, chemical, biological and human phenomena. Examples include molecular encounters in reactions, cellular signalling, the foraging of animals, the spread of diseases, as well as trends in financial markets and climate records. Deviations from Brownian diffusion, known as anomalous diffusion (AnDi), can often be observed in these processes, when the growth of the mean square displacement in time is not linear. An ever-increasing number of methods has thus appeared to characterize anomalous diffusion trajectories based on classical statistics or machine learning approaches. Yet, characterization of anomalous diffusion remains challenging to date as testified by the launch of the AnDi challenge in March 2020 to assess and compare new and pre-existing methods on three different aspects of the problem: the inference of the anomalous diffusion exponent, the classification of the diffusion model, and the segmentation of trajectories. Here, we introduce a novel method (CONDOR) which combines feature engineering based on classical statistics with supervised deep learning to efficiently identify the underlying anomalous diffusion model with high accuracy and infer its exponent with a small mean absolute error in single 1D, 2D and 3D trajectories corrupted by localization noise. Finally, we extend our method to the segmentation of trajectories where the diffusion model and/or its anomalous exponent vary in time.",,,,10.1088/1751-8121/ac0c5d,,Gentili und Volpe - 2021 - Characterization of anomalous diffusion classical .pdf:files/452/Gentili und Volpe - 2021 - Characterization of anomalous diffusion classical .pdf:application/pdf,,,"1751-8113, 1751-8121",Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical,,en,aug,,31.0,314003,,,,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1751-8121/ac0c5d,2023-07-04,54,2021.0,Anomaly detection,CNN,journal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper proposes a novel method to discover abnormal behaviors and judge abnormal behavior patterns using mobility trajectory data. Abnormal behavior trajectory refers to the behavior trajectory whose temporal and spatial characteristics are different from normal behavior, and it is an important clue to discover dangerous behavior. Abnormal patterns are the behavior patterns summarized based on the regular characteristics of criminals’ activities, including wandering, scouting, random walk, and trailing. This paper examines the abnormal behavior patterns based on mobility trajectories. A Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM)-based method is used to extract personal trajectory features, and the K-means clustering method is applied to extract abnormal trajectories from the trajectory dataset. Based on the characteristics of different abnormal behaviors, the spatio-temporal feature matching method is used to identify the abnormal patterns based on the ﬁltered abnormal trajectories.

Zakirul Alam",A Deep Learning-Based Mobile Crowdsensing Scheme by Predicting Vehicle Mobility,"Mobile crowdsensing is an emerging paradigm that selects users to complete sensing tasks. Recently, mobile vehicles are adopted to perform sensing data collection tasks in the urban city due to their ubiquity and mobility. In this article, we study how mobile vehicles can be optimally selected in order to collect maximum data from the urban environment in a future period of tens of minutes. We formulate the recruitment of vehicles as a maximum data limited budget problem. The application scenario is generalized to a realistic online setting where vehicles are continuously moving in real-time and the data center decides to recruit a set of vehicles immediately. A deep learning-based scheme through mobile vehicles (DLMV) is proposed to collect sensing data in the urban environment. We ﬁrst propose a deep learning-based ofﬂine algorithm to predict vehicle mobility in a future time period. Furthermore, we propose a greedy online algorithm to recruit a subset of vehicles with a limited budget for the NP-Complete problem. Extensive experimental evaluations are conducted on the real mobility dataset in Rome. The results have not only veriﬁed the efﬁciency of our proposed solution but also validated that DLMV can improve the quantity of collected sensing data compared with other algorithms.",,,,10.1109/TITS.2020.3023446,,Zhu et al. - 2021 - A Deep Learning-Based Mobile Crowdsensing Scheme b.pdf:files/427/Zhu et al. - 2021 - A Deep Learning-Based Mobile Crowdsensing Scheme b.pdf:application/pdf,,,"1524-9050, 1558-0016",IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,,en,jul,,7.0,4648--4659,,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9216548/,2023-07-04,22,2021.0,Traffic volume prediction,LSTM-Autoencoder,journal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fan_evaluating_2021,article,"Fan, Chao and Jiang, Xiangqi and Mostafavi, Ali",Evaluating crisis perturbations on urban mobility using adaptive reinforcement learning,"The objective of this study is to propose and test an adaptive reinforcement learning model that can learn the patterns of human mobility in a normal context and simulate the mobility during perturbations caused by crises, such as flooding, wildfire, and hurricanes. Understanding and evaluating human mobility patterns, such as destination and trajectory selection, can inform emerging congestion and road closures raised by disruptions in emergencies. Data related to human movement trajectories are scarce, especially in the context of emergencies, which places a limitation on applications of existing urban mobility models learned from empirical data. Models with the capability of learning the mobility patterns from data generated in normal situations and which can adapt to emergency situations are needed to inform emergency response and urban resilience assessments. To address this gap, this study creates and tests an adaptive reinforcement learning model that can predict the destinations of movements, estimate the trajectory for each origin and destination pair, and examine the impact of perturbations on humans’ decisions related to destinations and movement trajectories. Employing millions of trajectory data from INRIX, the application of the proposed model is shown in the context of Houston and the flooding scenario caused by Hurricane Harvey in August 2017. The results show that the model can achieve more than 76\% precision and recall at the model learning stage. The mean percentage error of the travel distance in predicted trajectories is 4.29\%, compared to the travel distances in empirical data. In addition, predicted density of vehicles in grid cells are negatively associated with the traffic speed on road segments and inundation intensity in grid cells during the flooding. The results from the simulation further show that the model could predict traffic patterns and congestion resulting from urban flooding. The outcomes of the analysis demonstrate the capabilities of the model for analyzing urban mobility during crises, which can inform the public and decision-makers about the response strategies and resilience planning to reduce the impacts of crises on urban mobility.",,,,10.1016/j.scs.2021.103367,,Fan et al. - 2021 - Evaluating crisis perturbations on urban mobility .pdf:files/388/Fan et al. - 2021 - Evaluating crisis perturbations on urban mobility .pdf:application/pdf,,,22106707,Sustainable Cities and Society,,en,dec,,,103367,,,,https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2210670721006429,2023-07-04,75,2021.0,Next location / final destination prediction,Adaptive reinforcement learning,journal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
li_urban_2021,article,"Li, Can and Bai, Lei and Liu, Wei and Yao, Lina and Travis Waller, S.",Urban mobility analytics A deep spatial–temporal product neural network for traveler attributes inference,"This study examines the potential of using smart card data in public transit systems to infer at­ tributes of travelers, thereby facilitating a more user-centered public transport service design while reducing the use of expensive and time-consuming travel surveys. This is challenging since travel behaviors vary significantly over the population, space, and time and developing mean­ ingful links between them and traveler attributes are not trivial. To achieve this, we conduct an extensive analysis of spatio-temporal travel behavior patterns using smart card data from the Greater Sydney area (Opal card), and then develop a Hybrid Neural Network to utilize spatial and temporal dependencies in the dataset. In particular, we first empirically analyze passengers’ movements and mobility patterns from both spatial and temporal perspectives and design a set of discriminative features to characterize the patterns. We then propose a deep-learning-based framework to investigate spatial and temporal features in order to infer traveler attributes. The proposed modeling framework consists of two components, i.e., a Product-based Spa­ tial–Temporal Module (PSTM) and an Auto-Encoder-based Compression Module (AECM). PSTM encodes the relationships across a variety of features while AECM derives useful spatial infor­ mation from a transit stop matrix. The proposed model is tested and evaluated using a large-scale public transport dataset in the Greater Sydney area to infer two attributes of passengers, i.e., the age group and residential area. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method against a number of established tools in the literature. The developed tech­ niques can be potentially adapted to other domains where spatio-temporal features are critical, such as commercial/entertainment site selection and urban service planning.",,,,10.1016/j.trc.2020.102921,,Li et al. - 2021 - Urban mobility analytics A deep spatial–temporal .pdf:files/376/Li et al. - 2021 - Urban mobility analytics A deep spatial–temporal .pdf:application/pdf,,,0968090X,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,,en,mar,,,102921,,Urban mobility analytics,,https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0968090X20308202,2023-07-04,124,2021.0,(Sub)trajectory classification,Autoencoder (PSTM),journal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Particularly, an interesting topic has attracted the attention of researchers that is to link trajectories to users (TUL). Despite the signiﬁcant progress made by recent deep learning-based human mobility learning models, tackling TUL problem is still challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel reinforced trajectory learning approach called GraphTUL that implements an adversarial network with the policy gradient to improve the identiﬁcation ability and leverages both labeled and unlabeled trajectories to address the insufﬁcient label issue in a semi-supervised manner. Besides, some critical factors related to personal context and indispensable elements in current mobility learning models are still missing. Thus, we propose a novel graph-based human motion representation model (CGE) to exploit the contextual information from users’ trajectories for alleviating data sparsity and contextual constraint issues. CGE builds a uniﬁed graph with historical check-ins to reﬂect users’ geographical preferences and visiting intentions. It allows us to sample synthetic but realistic trajectories for augmenting data and enhancing contextual check-in embedding. We also successfully apply it to next check-in prediction task.

Seniors suffering from such impairments notice a slight deterioration in their cognitive abilities, which may lead to memory loss and behavioural disorders. In consequence, such seniors refrain from doing their everyday outdoor activities. Technology, e.g. smartphones, wearables and artiﬁcial intelligence, can provide seniors and their relatives with a variety of monitoring tools. In a nutshell, locations are analysed and, under speciﬁc situations, alarms are raised so that caregivers urgently informed. In this context, the discovery and prediction of trajectories and behaviours play a key role in deploying effective monitoring solutions. In this paper, we present a real-time smartphone-based monitoring system, called SafeMove, to discover and predict elderly people behaviours by analyzing outdoor trajectories. This is achieved by ﬁrstly analysing the elder’s mobility data previously collected using the proposed model called SpaceTime-Convolutional Neural Network (ST-CNN) in order to predict the most popular locations he/she might visit in the next time. Based on the predicted locations, the elder can be monitored in bounded region. Time and space-related variables, such as the distance traversed, the direction of the movements and the time spent, are analyzed in our abnormal behaviour detection (ABD) model that takes advantage of recurrent neural networks (RNNs).

However, the tremendous growth of vessel trajectories, collected from the combined satellite-terrestrial AIS (automatic identiﬁcation system) base stations, could lead to unsatisfactory maritime safety and efﬁcacy. To promote smart trafﬁc services in maritime IoT, it is necessary to accurately and robustly predict the spatiotemporal vessel trajectories. It is beneﬁcial for collision avoidance, maritime surveillance, and abnormal behavior detection, etc. Motivated by the strong learning capacity of deep neural networks, this work proposes an AIS data-driven trajectory prediction framework, whose main component is a long short term memory (LSTM) network. In particular, the vessel trafﬁc conﬂict situation modeling, generated using the dynamic AIS data and social force concept, is embedded into the LSTM network to guarantee high-accuracy vessel trajectory prediction.

Compared with classical prediction methods, recently published ones based on neural networks have made significant improvements, but there still exist problems. First, several valuable characteristics in human mobility, such as the geographic relevance, community, and diversity of user movements, are not fully exploited. Second, the sparsity and imbalance of the check-in data also greatly restrict the prediction performance. To alleviate them, this manuscript proposes a new human mobility prediction method called the group-based multi-features move (GMFMove). This method constructs a prediction model based on recurrent neural network and attention mechanism. Three important factors that inﬂuence user movements, i.e., the sequence of location, the category of location, and the geographic relevance of human mobility, are taken into consideration in the model to better capture the mobility preference. Furthermore, GMFMove uses a deeplearning-based matrix factorization to integrate prior information including implicit feedbacks and social relationships for grouping users. Then, for each user group, we use a separate multi-features move (MFMove) model to train it and get the subresult. Finally, all of them are integrated in terms of the weights to obtain the ﬁnal prediction result.

However, most of the existing research concentrates on fusing different semantics underlying sequential trajectories for mobility pattern learning which, in turn, yields a narrow perspective on comprehending human intrinsic motions. In addition, the inherent sparsity and under-explored heterogeneous collaborative items pertaining to human check-ins hinder the potential exploitation of human diverse periodic regularities as well as common interests. Motivated by recent advances in disentanglement learning, in this study we propose a novel disentangled solution called SSDL for tackling the next POI prediction problem. SSDL primarily seeks to disentangle the potential time-invariant and time-varying factors into different latent spaces from massive trajectories data, providing an interpretable view to understand the intricate semantics underlying human diverse mobility representations. To address the data sparsity issue, we present two realistic trajectory augmentation approaches to enhance the understanding of both the human intrinsic periodicity and constantly-changing intents. In addition, we devise a POI-centric graph structure to explore heterogeneous collaborative signals underlying historical check-ins.

kim_deep_2022,article,"Kim, Jong Wook and Jang, Beakcheol",Deep learning-based privacy-preserving framework for synthetic trajectory generation,"Synthetic data generation based on state-of-the-art deep learning methods has recently emerged as a promising solution to replace the expensive and laborious collection of real data. Accordingly, several deep learning approaches have been developed to generate synthetic trajectories. These existing solutions assume that a dataset of true trajectories is available with sufficient size to train a deep learning model. However, considering that the trajectories usually contain sensitive information that individuals do not wish to disclose, this assumption is unrealistic in real world applications. We propose a novel privacy-preserving framework designed to effectively generate synthetic trajectories. In contrast to existing solutions to this problem, the proposed method exploits a differential privacy mechanism for collecting training data from individual users to protect the privacy of their locations.

Users usually have multiple online identities (IDs) in different online services. In order to fuse the separated user data in multiple services for better business intelligence, it is critical for service providers to link online IDs belonging to the same user. On the other hand, the popularity of mobile networks and GPS-equipped smart devices have provided a generic way to link IDs, i.e., utilizing the mobility traces of IDs. However, linking IDs based on their mobility traces has been a challenging problem due to the highly heterogeneous, incomplete and noisy mobility data across services. In this paper, we propose DPLink, an end-to-end deep learning based framework, to complete the user identity linkage task for heterogeneous mobility data collected from different services with different properties. DPLink is made up by a feature extractor including a location encoder and a trajectory encoder to extract representative features from trajectory and a comparator to compare and decide whether to link two trajectories as the same user. Particularly, we propose a pre-training strategy with a simple task to train the DPLink model to overcome the training difﬁculties introduced by the highly heterogeneous nature of different source mobility data. Besides, we introduce a multi-modal embedding network and a co-attention mechanism in DPLink to deal with the low-quality problem of mobility data. By conducting extensive experiments on two real-life ground-truth mobility datasets with eight baselines, we demonstrate that DPLink outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions by more than 15 percent in terms of hit-precision. Moreover, it is expandable to add external geographical context data and works stably with heterogeneous noisy mobility traces.",,,,10.1109/TKDE.2020.2989732,,Feng et al. - 2022 - User Identity Linkage via Co-Attentive Neural Netw.pdf:files/371/Feng et al. - 2022 - User Identity Linkage via Co-Attentive Neural Netw.pdf:application/pdf,,,"1041-4347, 1558-2191, 2326-3865",IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,,en,feb,,2.0,954--968,,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9076832/,2023-07-04,34,2022.0,(Sub)trajectory classification,encoder,journal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, many people from various positions of the city drive their cars to speciﬁed areas, and then they will stop and stay for a certain period of time, leading to a spatiotemporal evolution of urban area attractiveness (AA). In this paper, we aim at understanding urban AA based on analyses of private car trajectory datasets. Speciﬁcally, by extracting point-of-stop (PoS) data from the private car trajectories, we design the variational Bayesian Gaussian mixture models (VBGMM) to deduce the probability density distribution of PoSs and connect it to the variation of AA. We establish a deep learning model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) to capture the evolution of the AA. Furthermore, we integrate dropout in the LSTM method to address challenging issues such as overﬁtting and time-consuming training of complex neural networks in the AA prediction. We conduct experiments by using realworld private car trajectory data to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results validate that our proposed method outperforms existing ones in terms of various metrics. To the authors’ knowledge, our work is the ﬁrst one to utilize private car trajectory data to study urban area attractiveness, thereby facilitating a new perspective regarding an understanding of human travel behavior and the evolution of urban mobility.",,,,10.1109/TITS.2021.3113705,,Xiao et al. - 2022 - Understanding Urban Area Attractiveness Based on P.pdf:files/369/Xiao et al. - 2022 - Understanding Urban Area Attractiveness Based on P.pdf:application/pdf,,,"1524-9050, 1558-0016",IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,,en,aug,,8.0,12343--12352,,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9547061/,2023-07-04,23,2022.0,(Sub)trajectory classification,LSTM,journal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
jiang_time-aware_2022,inproceedings,"Jiang, Linlang and Zhou, Jingbo and Xu, Tong and Li, Yanyan and Chen, Hao and Dou, Dejing",Time-aware Neural Trip Planning Reinforced by Human Mobility,"Trip planning, which targets at planning a trip consisting of several ordered Points of Interest (POIs) under user-provided constraints, has long been treated as an important application for location-based services. The goal of trip planning is to maximize the chance that the users will follow the planned trip while it is difﬁcult to directly quantify and optimize the chance. Conventional methods either leverage statistical analysis to rank POIs to form a trip or generate trips following predeﬁned objectives based on constraint programming to bypass such a problem. However, these methods may fail to reﬂect the complex latent patterns hidden in the human mobility data. On the other hand, though there are a few deep learning-based trip recommendation methods, these methods still cannot handle the time budget constraint so far. To this end, we propose a TImeaware Neural Trip Planning (TINT) framework to tackle the above challenges. First of all, we devise a novel attention-based encoder-decoder trip generator that can learn the correlations among POIs and generate trips under given constraints. Then, we propose a specially-designed reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm to directly optimize the objective to obtain an optimal trip generator. For this purpose, we introduce a discriminator, which distinguishes the generated trips from real-life trips taken by users, to provide reward signals to optimize the generator. Subsequently, to ensure the feedback from the discriminator is always instructive, we integrate an adversarial learning strategy into the RL paradigm to update the trip generator and the discriminator alternately. Moreover, we devise a novel pretraining schema to speed up the convergence for an efﬁcient training process. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and efﬁciency of our framework, which shows that TINT could remarkably outperform the state-of-theart baselines within short response time.","Padua, Italy",,2022 {International} {Joint} {Conference} on {Neural} {Networks} ({IJCNN}),10.1109/IJCNN55064.2022.9892652,,Jiang et al. - 2022 - Time-aware Neural Trip Planning Reinforced by Huma.pdf:files/362/Jiang et al. - 2022 - Time-aware Neural Trip Planning Reinforced by Huma.pdf:application/pdf,,978-1-72818-671-9,,,,en,jul,,,1--8,IEEE,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9892652/,2023-07-04,,2022.0,Estimated Time of Arrival,"Autoencoder, Reinforcement learning",article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ezequiel_federated_2022,article,"Ezequiel, Castro Elizondo Jose and Gjoreski, Martin and Langheinrich, Marc",Federated Learning for Privacy-Aware Human Mobility Modeling,"Human mobility modeling is a complex yet essential subject of study related to modeling important spatiotemporal events, including trafﬁc, disease spreading, and customized directions and recommendations. While spatiotemporal data can be collected easily via smartphones, current state-of-the-art deep learning methods require vast amounts of such privacy-sensitive data to generate useful models. This work investigates the creation of spatiotemporal models using a Federated Learning (FL) approach—a machine learning technique that avoids sharing personal data with centralized servers. More speciﬁcally, we examine three centralized models for next-place prediction: a simple Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model, as well as two state-of-the-art centralized approaches, Flashback and DeepMove. Flashback is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that utilizes historical hidden states with similar context as the current spatiotemporal context to improve performance. DeepMove is an attentional RNN that aims to capture human mobility’s regularity while coping with data sparsity. We then implemented models based on FL for the two best-performing centralized models. We compared the performance of all models using two large public datasets: Foursquare (9,450 million check-ins, February 2009 to October 2010) and Gowalla (3,300 million check-ins, April 2012 to January 2014). We ﬁrst replicated the performance of both Flashback and DeepMove, as reported in the original studies, and compared them to the simple GRU model. Flashback and GRU proved to be the best performing centralized models, so we further explored both in FL scenarios, including several parameters such as the number of clients, rounds, and epochs. Our results indicated that the training process of the federated models was less stable, i.e., the FL versions of both Flashback and GRU tended to have higher variability in the loss curves. The higher variability led to a slower convergence and thus a poorer performance when compared to the corresponding centralized models. Model performance was also highly inﬂuenced by the number of federated clients and the sparsity of the evaluation dataset. We additionally provide insights into the technical challenges of applying FL to state-of-the-art deep learning methods for human mobility.",,,,10.3389/frai.2022.867046,,Ezequiel et al. - 2022 - Federated Learning for Privacy-Aware Human Mobilit.pdf:files/448/Ezequiel et al. - 2022 - Federated Learning for Privacy-Aware Human Mobilit.pdf:application/pdf,,,2624-8212,Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence,,en,jun,,,867046,,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frai.2022.867046/full,2023-07-04,5,2022.0,Traffic volume prediction,GRU,journal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under the umbrella of the crime opportunity theory, that suggests that human mobility can play a role in crime generation, increasing attention has been paid to the predictive power of human mobility in place-based short-term crime models. Researchers have used call detail records (CDR), data from location-based services such as Foursquare or from social media to characterize human mobility; and have shown that mobility metrics, together with historical crime data, can improve short-term crime prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose to use a publicly available ﬁne-grained human mobility dataset from a location intelligence company to explore the eﬀects of human mobility features on short-term crime prediction. For that purpose, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple cities with diverse demographic characteristics, diﬀerent types of crimes and various deep learning models; and we show that adding human mobility ﬂow features to historical crimes can improve the F1 scores for a variety of neural crime prediction models across cities and types of crimes, with improvements ranging from 2\% to 7\%.

gu_short-term_2022,article,"Gu, Jinjing and Jiang, Zhibin and “David” Fan, Wei and Chen, Jingjing",Short-term trajectory prediction for individual metro passengers integrating diverse mobility patterns with adaptive location-awareness,"Short-term trajectory prediction (StTP) for individual metro passengers is of great importance in intelligent transportation systems and real-time security risk management. Existing research efforts still have shortcomings in constructing an interpretable StTP model with limited historical trajectory data for individual metro passengers. This paper thus intends to enhance the existing StTP methods in two aspects: (1) encoding the trajectory sequences with universal and personalized mobility rules to explain the mobility patterns of metro passengers, and (2) constructing an interpretable StTP model with adaptive location-awareness to improve the prediction accuracy. Along this line, this study develops a novel framework for individual metro passengers by integrating diverse mobility patterns with adaptive location-awareness (StTP-ML). Particularly, a trajectory representation approach is proposed to process the observed Wi-Fi probe data and transfer them into structured trajectories. Then, the diverse mobility patterns of individual passengers are discovered, including temporal periodicity, spatial symmetry, and sequence correlation. Finally, an adaptive location-aware model integrated with individual diverse mobility patterns-priority strategy is constructed. To evaluate the proposed StTP-ML model, this research also conducts experiments on real-world passenger trajectory data at a busy metro station in Shanghai, China. The experimental results show that the average accuracy rate of the StTP-ML-E model is improved up to 84\%, which outperforms all other baseline models in the test. It demonstrates that the proposed StTP-ML model can integrate more interpretable mobility patterns than the baseline models and provide more accurate trajectories for individual metro passengers in future time periods.",,,,10.1016/j.ins.2022.03.074,,Gu et al. - 2022 - Short-term trajectory prediction for individual me.pdf:files/378/Gu et al. - 2022 - Short-term trajectory prediction for individual me.pdf:application/pdf,,,00200255,Information Sciences,,en,jun,,,25--43,,,,https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0020025522003000,2023-07-04,599,2022.0,Trajectory prediction/imputation,ML (Variable n-gram model),journal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ren_transcode_2023,article,"Ren, Jinfu and Liu, Mutong and Liu, Yang and Liu, Jiming",TransCode Uncovering COVID-19 transmission patterns via deep learning,"Background  The heterogeneity of COVID-19 spread dynamics is determined by complex spatiotemporal transmission patterns at a fine scale, especially in densely populated regions. In this study, we aim to discover such fine-scale transmission patterns via deep learning.
Methods  We introduce the notion of TransCode to characterize fine-scale spatiotemporal transmission patterns of COVID-19 caused by metapopulation mobility and contact behaviors. First, in Hong Kong, China, we construct the mobility trajectories of confirmed cases using their visiting records. Then we estimate the transmissibility of individual cases in different locations based on their temporal infectiousness distribution. Integrating the spatial and temporal information, we represent the TransCode via spatiotemporal transmission networks. Further, we propose a deep transfer learning model to adapt the TransCode of Hong Kong, China to achieve fine-scale transmission characterization and risk prediction in six densely populated metropolises: New York City, San Francisco, Toronto, London, Berlin, and Tokyo, where fine-scale data are limited. All the data used in this study are publicly available.
Results  The TransCode of Hong Kong, China derived from the spatial transmission information and temporal infectiousness distribution of individual cases reveals the transmission patterns (e.g., the imported and exported transmission intensities) at the district and constituency levels during different COVID-19 outbreaks waves. By adapting the TransCode of Hong Kong, China to other data-limited densely populated metropolises, the proposed method outperforms other representative methods by more than 10\% in terms of the prediction accuracy of the disease dynamics (i.e., the trend of case numbers), and the fine-scale spatiotemporal transmission patterns in these metropolises could also be well captured due to some shared intrinsically common patterns of human mobility and contact behaviors at the metapopulation level.
Conclusions  The fine-scale transmission patterns due to the metapopulation level mobility (e.g., travel across different districts) and contact behaviors (e.g., gathering in social-economic centers) are one of the main contributors to the rapid spread of the virus. Characterization of the fine-scale transmission patterns using the TransCode will facilitate the development of tailor-made intervention strategies to effectively contain disease transmission in the targeted regions.",,,,10.1186/s40249-023-01052-9,,Ren et al. - 2023 - TransCode Uncovering COVID-19 transmission patter.pdf:files/352/Ren et al. - 2023 - TransCode Uncovering COVID-19 transmission patter.pdf:application/pdf,,,2049-9957,Infectious Diseases of Poverty,,en,feb,,1.0,14,,{TransCode},,https://idpjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40249-023-01052-9,2023-07-04,12,2023.0,Traffic volume prediction,"GRU, transfer learning, autoencoder",journal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The explosion of mobility data prompted the application of deep learning to human mobility. Along with the growth of research interest, there is also increasing privacy concern. This study first examines the cutting-edge approaches for trajectory generation, classification, and next-location prediction. Second, we propose a novel privacy-aware approach for predicting next-week trajectories. The approach is based on two modules, a Generative Adversarial Network used for generating synthetic trajectories and a deep learning model for user identification which safeguards privacy. These two modules are combined with a next-week trajectory predictor that uses privacy-aware synthetic data. The experiments on two real-life datasets show that the generator creates trajectories similar to the real ones yet different enough to safeguard privacy. The low user-recognition recognition accuracy of models trained on the generated data demonstrates privacy awareness. Statistical tests confirm no significant difference between the original and the generated trajectories. We further demonstrate the utility of the synthetic data by predicting week-ahead trajectories based on the synthetic trajectories.

However, existing models fail to achieve satisfactory performance for low-quality (i.e., noisy, low-frequency, and non-uniform) trajectory data. To this end, we propose a general and robust deep learning-based model,
              L2MM

              and
              enhancement with the data distribution

The former employs high-frequency trajectories to enhance the expressive capability of representations, while the latter regularizes the representation distribution over the latent space to improve the generalization ability of representations. Secondly, to embrace more heuristic clues, typical mobility patterns are recognized in the latent space and further incorporated into the map matching task. Finally, based on the available representations and patterns, a mapping from trajectories to corresponding paths is constructed through a joint optimization method. Extensive experiments are conducted based on a range of datasets, which demonstrate the superiority of

In the individual mobility analysis, the problem of next trip prediction assumes a central role and is beneficial for applications such as personalized services and mobility management. This paper addresses the next trip prediction problem with arbitrary prediction times (the time when the prediction is made). This problem has not been studied adequately in the literature and it is important for applications driven by system events, such as proactive travel recommendations under disruptions or crowding in transport systems. It predicts an individual’s next trips given their historical trip sequences and the prediction time. We formulate the next trip prediction problem as on-board and off-board predictions depending on an individual’s travel status (i.e. on-board/off-board). Using historical/real-time travel trajectories, a DeepTrip model is proposed based on a trip sequence-to-sequence deep learning structure coupled with an attention mechanism. A novel overlapped embedding method is proposed to represent continuous travel attributes capturing simultaneously the categorical and numerical feature information. We also develop a random-sampling training algorithm to learn the impact of the prediction time. The model is validated using trip data in urban rails. The results show that DeepTrip outperforms statistical-based models by more than 10\% in terms of accuracy and other deep learning models by 2\%-3\%. The impact analysis shows that different representations are appropriate for the two prediction cases (on-board/off-board), and the prediction performance does not monotonically improve as the prediction time approaches the next trip.",,,,10.1109/TITS.2023.3252043,,Zhang et al. - 2023 - DeepTrip A Deep Learning Model for the Individual.pdf:files/441/Zhang et al. - 2023 - DeepTrip A Deep Learning Model for the Individual.pdf:application/pdf,,,"1524-9050, 1558-0016",IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,,en,jun,,6.0,5842--5855,,{DeepTrip},,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10074989/,2023-07-04,24,2023.0,Next location / final destination prediction,LSTM,journal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wang_novel_2023,article,"Wang, Jifei and Feng, Chen-Chieh and Guo, Zhou",A Novel Graph-Based Framework for Classifying Urban Functional Zones with Multisource Data and Human Mobility Patterns,"Recent research has shown the advantages of incorporating multisource geospatial data into the classiﬁcation of urban functional zones (UFZs), particularly remote sensing and social sensing data. However, the effects of combining datasets of varying quality have not been thoroughly analyzed. In addition, human mobility patterns from social sensing data, which capture signals of human activities, are often represented by origin-destination pairs, thus ignoring spatial relationships between UFZs embedded in mobility trajectories. To address the aforementioned issues, this study proposed a graph-based UFZ classiﬁcation framework that fuses semantic features from high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing images, points of interest, and GPS trajectory data. The framework involves three main steps: (1) High-level scene information in HSR remote sensing imageries was extracted through deep neural networks, and multisource semantic embeddings were constructed based on physical features and social sensing features from multiple geospatial data sources; (2) UFZ mobility graph was constructed by spatially joining trajectory information with UFZs to construct topological connections between functional parcel segments; and (3) UFZ segments and multisource semantic features were transformed into nodes and embeddings in the mobility graphs, and subsequently graph-based models were adopted to identify UFZs. The proposed framework was tested on Zhuhai and Singapore datasets. Results indicated that it outperformed traditional classiﬁcation methods with an overall accuracy of 76.7\% and 84.5\% for Zhuhai and Singapore datasets, respectively. The proposed framework contributes to literature in heterogeneous data fusion and is generalizable to other UFZ classiﬁcation scenarios where human mobility patterns play a role.",,,,10.3390/rs15030730,,Wang et al. - 2023 - A Novel Graph-Based Framework for Classifying Urba.pdf:files/469/Wang et al. - 2023 - A Novel Graph-Based Framework for Classifying Urba.pdf:application/pdf,,,2072-4292,Remote Sensing,,en,jan,,3.0,730,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/15/3/730,2023-07-04,15,2023.0,(Sub)trajectory classification,Graph-based,journal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
